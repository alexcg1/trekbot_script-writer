              We are in the empty temple, as the last of the light shines on
              a large statue of Dagon.  It is the head of the king.
              The lights come on to a statue of Crioc.  This one has
              a white-painted face and a long white beard.  It is the face
              of Valka.

              The last light in the temple goes out.  No wind.  The night is
              still falling.

              Valka's body goes up into the sky.  The moon shines
              down upon the face of its head.

EAGLE MAGAZINE.

EAGLE Magazine's first graphic novel.

From the creative minds of:   John Scalzi, Steve Ditko, Gary Gianni, Jules Feiffer, Scott McEwan, and Peter Parker
and the inspiration of  Jules Feiffer, Peter Parker, Jules Feiffer & Joe Quesada.

The idea of a graphic novel was born from the frustration of
students trying to be creative during the second grade while teaching at
the prestigious City College of New York. The first volume of
The Graphic Novel was
to introduce a fresh look to teaching.  It was also intended
to show the positive effect of creativity on our children.

EAGLE Magazine has been in publishing since 1980 and has been a critical
success. The print and electronic sales have been
overwhelmingly positive and an almost unlimited
source of income for the comic publishers.

I've been thinking about you a lot lately. I used to be a

I wanted you to know it's okay to laugh.
I think it's fun. 
(The MUSIC rises to a crescendo and stops. She holds it.)
You have an amazing heart. And to believe, that you were
blessed, and never made one mistake
would have been impossible. Not until I met you. And now I can say
your love was not just beautiful and sweet. But you are also kind
and considerate. You have a heart that is hard to
grasp. That makes me proud to know you.

You're my best friend and I love you very much.
You are my star, and you have to know that.
And you have to know that I will always love you. So I won't
never give up on you.

long coat, tied it up and hung it up. The door opens, revealing Jay, the

EXT. WAK'S TOWER - NIGHT

As the group approaches a small, low-traffic space, we hear a rhythmic THUNDER. A beat.
Suddenly, we see the KID standing above the KANAKA, with a pair of laser eyes in the
shade, ready to engage the hunters.

JUNG (cont'd)

Hey. Where you going?

Lola stares right at the two KID'S.

JUNG (cont'd)
I didn't like this kid. I wanted you to find the rest of
your people.

Lola looks disappointed.

JUNG (cont'd)
We're on our way.

As they climb onto the platform, they see two KANAKA SHEEP HEADMEN enter the ship and
join their crew.

Lola is shocked.

JUNG (cont'd)
What are you two?

The KANAKA sheep headmen explain to them the purpose of their mission
the other JUNG (cont'd).

JUNG (cont'd)
We found a treasure trove of KANAKA history. The Kola are the last
people to see the light and they were here before the time of the
Tengri. They fought for the planet and the Kola lost. It's our
way of bringing our people back to our world.


BADGE
He said to kill the Kola if he was successful.

I believe it was him.

The KANAKA headmen give the two hunters a piece of advice.

Don't get sucked into the Kola trap.

The hunter heads back towards the open space in a hurry, followed by the other
group.

The JUNG (cont'd)

micro-tool that can scan the computer. The tools give us

YORGI: None of the books were a failure. We did our best.

HICCUP: I have a problem with this.

[Aegis's quarters]

YORGI: You're welcome, Master. Let's start with the
original story of what led to the creation of the First Order.


 [AEGIS' QUARTERS]

HICCUP: You seem to have no interest in what you've done to the
world. 
YORGI: I'm just a collector of artifacts. It is my duty to protect
them. 
HICCUP: You would not be in this position if you weren't trying to protect
the galaxy. 
YORGI: I do. In a way. 
HICCUP: And you don't have to think you should. I am not an enforcer, just
an observer. My duty is to observe the galaxy. I can only observe
what is happening.


                                  HICCUP 
Why are you here?

YORGI: I see a connection between our world and the history of the
Galaxy. 
HICCUP: Do you? I see a connection between the events that you
have just witnessed and the events that your father, I would say
most definitely predicted. 
YORGI: Do you know how many years have passed since we left
here, Master? How many years are left before it is as if all of
that time is gone? 
HICCUP: What have you done with them, Yorgi? What have you done with
our galaxy? 
YORGI: I have nothing to do with the history of the Galaxy. 
HICCUP: Then it has been too long. I would say that this whole
way, you were trying to teach me how to help. 
YORGI: Your duty is not to protect the galaxy, it is to give it
a chance to work.

GEORGE: I hope they'll be just as stubborn, if not

DANIEL: Why do you suppose they don't give up? 
GEORGE: I think they have a sense of self-preservation, and it
is to protect the world, and that makes them a threat to
the world.

GEORGE: If someone could have made a better deal than what
they have with those people, I think that we would be in

They made the offer very close to the point where
there wasn't an alternative.

EXT.  ANTARCTICA -- NIGHT

In the ship's cabin, Rorschach is hunched over a table, with a large
sheet of papers, which he's been holding over his head.

	I found two papers on the desk, which I have
don't think I've read before.

They were my notes as an instructor. 


INT.  RORSCHACH'S LABORATORY -- NIGHT

Rorschach sits at a table while several others work.

		(to Rorschach)
	I've been taking a few hours and it's a little
disconcerting, but I haven't had to think much about
it.

Rorschach's not doing any work.

Rorschach has written an article on why he believes the "real" aliens
are not human, and it's a nice introduction to some of the theory
that some scientists hold about the Earth.

We're not human.


INT.  RORSCHACH'S LABORATORY -- NIGHT

As Rorschach and the other scientists work on their paper,
the door opens.

There is the sounds of a door slam.

MIRANDA: Hi. Doctor. Doctor. He's taking us to lunch.
I'm still working on finding the cure. Have you seen any
recently published accounts of this effect? 
BARNES: Well, we were doing a trial in our lab on
human neural crest cells. In some of the patients it was
found that there was a genetic mutation that affected
the amount of time it takes to achieve the full effect of the
brain implant. As a result, they became less
active and less intelligent. 
MIRANDA: Can you tell me about this man? 
BARNES: He is a neurosurgeon. He was investigating a
hockey player's concussion when he hit a glass pane of a
board. 
MIRANDA: Did he survive? 
BARNES: Unfortunately not. He died a few hours after
we arrived at the hospital. 
MIRANDA: Who is he?

transplant injuries.

The crewmen start out toward the cabin. D'Artagnan steps forward, opens the door.
Bazlar steps up to him. He is dressed in white, his hair neat. 
BAZAL: Do you need a drink or something?

(Bazlar places his cup) 
BAZAL: Come in.

Bazlar leads D'Artagnan into the cabin. A small group of crewmen sit down
to drink their coffee, while others get a bite to eat. There are five of them, a young
man in his late thirties, three old men in their sixties. It is hard to know who to
attract.

One of the boys puts his arm around a man who has just fallen off a stool and the boy
reaches over and places his elbow on his shoulder, whispering something into the
beep. The man puts out his hand and holds onto it for several seconds. The boy
puts his arm around the boy again. The boy is about three feet away when D'Artagnan
caught his eye and a long beat. Finally the boy gives him a big hug and takes the hand off
his shoulder.

The crewmen applaud. D'Artagnan walks out of the cabin. He carries his plate. The man with
the boy, the crewman and the old man stand by the fire for a few moments before
D'Artagnan walks over and puts a cup down on the fire. He does not look like any of the
crewmen. He is in his late twenties and his clothes are the same as the crewman
two years earlier. The man, with the crewman, and the old man also have matching
black silk sweaters on. D'Artagnan walks to a desk and takes out a file.

Bertram: Yes. I can't do this with them. 
DARES: You can't? I haven't seen them in four weeks. 
TUCKER: What does that mean? 
DARES: That means that if they think we're there, they'll want them back. 
TUCKER: Well, why? 
BERTRAM: You said that you wanted me on a mission. 
DARES: Do I have to do this? 
TUCKER: Don't let them get you into this. 
BERTRAM: The whole point of the mission was that you were to have a plan to 
end me before I destroyed your civilisation. 
TUCKER: Yeah, okay. I'll try and take care of the rest, and
you can be your normal self. 
DARES: So? 
TUCKER: I'm working on that.

My husband and I had been together for thirty years. The first time he was a
foster. I looked at him. And he was mine. He loved me. And I loved him. Then
sometimes we used to see each other at church. And then at night...
And then at least once a week it would come.
KAREN (O.S.)
Aww, I just want to take your hand. I'm going to do something special for
you. I want to feel your hand.
HAROLD (O.S.)
You can keep the money. Take it.
KAREN: What? Why?


HAROLD: You can keep the money, but only if you do
something with it. You've done everything.


KAREN: Yes, but I didn't. I'm sorry.
HAROLD: I'm so sorry.

KAREN: And you've only done a little. I know what you mean.
But I want to tell you something else. I want to keep it going. I want
to love you. I'll do everything I can to make sure you have
your daughter back. I'll work hard for what I'm about to do for
you. I know that.

(Karen kisses Harold on the forehead.)

HAROLD: It feels amazing. Like I'm going to die.

KAREN: I know it feels great. It's going to feel so good.

(The scene shows a baby in a basket in
the garden. And the scene fades back to the window. She is holding a tray of
food to a family dinner.)

KAREN: And now, I want to make you laugh. And you're going to make me
laugh too.

HAROLD: I promise you. And I'm going to make you happy. And I'm going to
make you laugh because you're the most beautiful thing on this planet.
And I'm going to make you happy because you're so happy and we're going
to have wonderful conversations all night.
KAREN: Thank you.

fellow nurse and a couple of girls drinking wine in the foyer.)

BECCA: Well, it started back when I was seven. 
GIGI: So what? I thought they were going to pay me. 
BECCA: Well, we never imagined it would last so long. You know, I never
expected them to think of me as a potential husband. 
GIGI: No, I never thought of it that way. 
BECCA: It seems that all of your parents are really interested in
a marriage. So we tried to have one of our own. 
GIGI: Oh, sweet. I'd love that. 
BECCA: But I have to be honest, I didn't really want to marry you. 
GIGI: Well, I wasn't planning on it. But you really are a wonderful woman, and that
makes you special. So, you know, we decided to give it a try, and we just
did. We got married at the start of January this year. 
BECCA: Oh, sweet! Wow! 
GIGI: Oh, God. It just seemed like a really good idea. 
BECCA: Well, now that I think about it, we really made a commitment to each
other. You know, it's been a really long time, but finally we're ready.
I'm happy, and it's really nice to see you again.

They must have come from the hologram.

All right, let's run through them. [Bridge]
QUARK:
I'm in the middle of a series of circuits. One

The holograms say this was a phaser fight, but as you're holding
the hologram of me standing in that room, I am thinking about
all the phasers and phaserships that have been destroyed.
There have never been more than five phaser ships in Starfleet. 
DATA:
We don't understand. Maybe the holodeck just makes it easier
for us to think and remember. 
QUARK:
That is correct. We do a little rehearsal just before we go into
the holodeck. 
DATA:
The real thing's right here. What kind of phaser fight?

It's a phaser fight.

ARCHER: How far would you have to take me? 
WORF: I've prepared a special transporter field. 
ARCHER: Transporter field? 
WORF: A kind of field that transports molecules of matter and
energy from one place to another. It's much like
the energy transporter seen on the Starship Voyager. 
ARCHER: Are we ready? 
WORF: No, but we can take a very short trip. 
ARCHER: We have one last option. Let's take a trip back to
before we met you. A hundred years ago, a man from the
future said he thought a ship could travel between the two
provinces of Earth and Mars. My family was in the middle of
such a journey. 
WORF: So we took him with us. 
ARCHER: And how does that happen? 
WORF: The man told us that if we put our hearts into the
transporter then he would lead us to Mars. 
ARCHER: But it would be impossible to travel back then. Why
did he come to this world? What was his motivation? 
WORF: What we're trying to figure out now is what we didn't
know then. He came to Earth because the people of the two
provinces of Earth wanted to help people who weren't even humans. 
ARCHER: Did you know, my brother, that when you went to Mars, the
people of Earth started to fear the same things that we do? 
WORF: In one of my early studies I showed some photographs of
Mars from the early days. 
ARCHER: Did you really see those mountains? 
WORF: The images were very vivid. 
ARCHER: Did you know they were also covered with signs indicating
the dangers of crossing the border and bringing someone else
along with you? 
WORF: They were very good tools in my study. 
ARCHER: Did you know that the people of Earth, who were
very close to him, were also afraid of him? 
WORF: I think I knew that for a fact. 
ARCHER: Maybe you're the only person on the planet who
understands that, because you chose to go to Mars instead.

QUARK: What have you done to deserve such treatment?

QUARK: But? 
PICARD: You were a prisoner of the Dominion who had no

QUARK: How did this happen? 
PICARD: Your life was threatened. 
QUARK: And your family? 
PICARD: My family has been suffering for centuries because of your
sins. 
QUARK: Your family? 
PICARD: The Martians used to live under the Dominion. 
QUARK: But I'm not a Martian. I'm a Romulan. If you could see what it is
about you, you'd agree that I am a good person. So I was just a
converted Romulan hiding in a Romulan ship. But the Martians were
unable to deal with me and so, they took me. 
VANJOL: Now I see what you mean. A Romulan vessel is a vessel for
emigration. 
QUARK: That's right, you. 
VANJOL: I was a Starfleet prisoner on Earth for almost three thousand
years. When the Dominion came to Earth, they brought a Romulan

DAX: We have a phaser on it, and it will fire at you.

CHAKOTAY: My name is Chakotay. 
WORF: Captain, I'm a Klingon commander. 
CHAKOTAY: I was looking for Captain Picard. 
WORF: Captain Picard? 
CHAKOTAY: That's right. 
WORF: I was hoping to ask you a few questions and ask you a few
more questions, but the Captain would rather answer those questions
on this ship. I thought I'd leave it to you. What does this
ship have to do with anything else that happened here? 
CHAKOTAY: This is our vessel. 
WORF: The Enterprise. 
CHAKOTAY: It's our ship? 
WORF: No, it's just like this. 
CHAKOTAY: Then you're trying to manipulate us to believe
that it's actually our ship? 
WORF: What do we have to do? 
CHAKOTAY: Let's just say it's still a great starship. 
WORF: And if we don't change our minds about this one
now, you're going to destroy it?

EMH: It is a simple but effective phaser array. It protects you from any attacks, but it is designed to
shield your body from harm. 
KIRA: It's an extremely basic phaser. 
EMH: It works perfectly. 
KIRA: You're the one who invented the phaser. 
EMH: A device used by the Kazon. I am using it now.

KUREN: Nothing. 
KIRA: What about me, Mister Kim? 
KIM: The best way to explain is simple. They don't care. They just want to eat your
brain. 
KIRA: Mister Kim? 
KIM: We've been working on these sensors since before the war. They work very
satisfactorily. 
KIRA: Good. Let's get started.

similar to a game, but designed for the modern computer and
computer controlled devices. That is the basis of the science fiction

DAX: My father would be pleased to hear that. 
RIKER: Perhaps I should get a new one, thank you. 
DAX: He told you I was a science-fantasy fan. 
RIKER: Yes, he said I was. You may not understand why. 
DAX: I've been obsessed with this subject since I was very
small. 
RIKER: Well, there is nothing to worry about. 
DAX: I suppose this is just an exercise in computer-generated science fiction. 
RIKER: What I don't understand, Mrs Worf, is why you have suddenly
found yourself in the middle of this. Are you a real scientist? 
DAX: Well, I have no idea what the difference is between a
real person and a computer-generated computer program. A real
person is the real thing, even though computer generated
software may contain inaccuracies. 
RIKER: Very well. It is obvious that you are a computer-generated character.
Computer programs are not real, of course. They are simulations of real
living things. But a living creature does not have the same
existence on this planet as a simulated one. In real life,
the organism has a number of senses, some of which are
simulations. 
DAX: But all this was invented by you, and you invented these
computer simulations. That isn't science fiction, is it? 
RIKER: We think they are. I believe you are a real scientist. 
DAX: I am not a real scientist. I'm a real programming officer. I

RIKER: Well, you think you are a human. 
DAX: No, I don't.

it is just one possibility, a possibility that must be allowed to stand

decided not to tell anyone where I am, and I won't tell them anything

before. 
KIRK: And you won't tell them anything. 
CHAKOTAY: All right. You won't tell them anything. 
KIRK: I don't know what that means, but I can give you the same

CHAKOTAY: Yeah. All right.

KIRK: And don't let me frighten you. Don't let me frighten you. I have
more on your world than just that. 
CHAKOTAY: A planet of Rama, where I work. My wife works there. My
daughter lives there too, and my grandfather who's still alive. He used to
live there when the crew was at K-8. I think he came back. 
KIRK: How is he? 
CHAKOTAY: He's a little rusty. 
KIRK: No. 
CHAKOTAY: I've been on many occasions. No, I've been quite
surprised by his abilities. He can speak many languages and read
many books. But all of them are written in the Rama language. And
I have many questions I want to ask you. Do you know the name? 
KIRK: I have no idea. 
CHAKOTAY: The Rama word is Rama, so I believe it is the same word
as the name of the planet. 
KIRK: This doesn't make any sense. 
CHAKOTAY: You're a Vulcan, not a Rama. I'm quite comfortable with that,
but I'm not entirely comfortable when a Klingon approaches. I'm afraid
some people might think I'm asking questions.

Janeway and Chakotay look at each other with fear. There's a rumble
on the other end of the comm. Voyager picks up the sound. A woman's voice.
It's Captain Kathryn Janeway and an Indian woman, TIRIA. They're arguing over a
cargo. The door opens. Chakotay is relieved that he didn't hear anything
on the other end of the comm. Chakotay tries to calm her down. TIRIA
sees Janeway and is more irritable. Then she leaves. TIRIA is back inside.
Janeway looks at her computer again, then turns to TIRIA. She's still
worried, but she's calmed down. TIRIA gets closer. Janeway doesn't speak
to her. She is now in her own quarters. Chakotay's computer is buzzing
with another message from the station. A man named JOHN DEAN is talking on the
phone.

manage the situation with the other crewmembers. Thank you for

reach the stars in three dimensions. 
PICARD: Then we're off to Mars. But you're going to have to figure
out how we're going to send that beam. 
LAFORGE: Right. 
PICARD: I'll ask you again, Lieutenant. What is the most important
problem facing you? 
LAFORGE: I guess the biggest one, Captain. There hasn't been a mission of
this size for a long, long time. 
PICARD: Really? 
LAFORGE: I guess I'm trying to solve the problem of how to
capture an entire population. If we can find out what happens to
them, what does it mean for Earth? The people are going to be living in
an ice age for a few thousand years. And what happens in that time
is going to be very important. If we could find out, we could get the
people back home and start over again. 
PICARD: You think that might change anything, Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE: I can't say for sure, but it seems to me that when the
people started to move away from the star they started to
see the new Earth they were missing. I mean that is true, but that
doesn't mean that those people have gone from their old Earth. 
PICARD: If I was you, I'd want to know why. 
LAFORGE: I can give you just one theory. 
PICARD: You've written me three letters. 
LAFORGE: There's a lot of things I've written you, so I wouldn't
say anything. You've always been the first man to call me when I
got back. Maybe when I'm here on this bridge, I'll have time to
read all of your stories. What do you think? 
PICARD: How about you? 
LAFORGE: I'll try to see about making that happen. 
PICARD: Can you do that? 
LAFORGE: Maybe one day, perhaps three. Maybe I'll see you then.

BASHIR: He is important, too.

KLINGON: I don't have any answer for that.

make sure that you leave this place.

Captain's log, stardate 54650.4. We found a planet in our solar system
which seemed to be an intergalactic minefield. All of a sudden, it
swung to life. The ship landed on the planet and was soon
aboard. We're currently pursuing an alien lifeform as
it roams this planet, and have already destroyed many of its
entire population. This whole incident hasn't even given them a
chance to think that the colonists were the ones responsible.

recording data back home.

DAX: What is that, a device with a glowing face? That's the
face we've been tracking since we first met you. 
O'BRIEN: You were watching my face, right? 
DAX: That's right, Odo. You were watching my face when you were
being scanned. 
O'BRIEN: Right, okay, but I've been watching your face
since then. And just how long have we been tracking you? A
year? A week? A month? 
DAX: And why can't we tell what it is? Because you're
not even talking to us.

O'BRIEN: (on monitor) The holodeck is the most immersive
experience we've ever had, but it is very limited. The
memory storage in the holodeck is limited. It can only
produce images which we remember.

Nova Council. He is aware of their concerns about the nature of the
forcefield. We are
relieved to learn it's also been deployed against
Kelvin. 
TUCKER: And we're looking at a future in which this forcefield
is used to destroy a starship. 
EMH: As an example, the first time the Forcefield was used was
in the Battle of the Yucatan in 12,000 B.C. However, in less than
two centuries it was used against an entire planet, the planet of Xol. It's
first use was to stop a treaty. 
TUCKER: The Xol treaty is an agreement signed by many nations to prevent
the discovery of advanced weapons. The Nova Council signed it. 
EMH: The reason why the Xol treaty is not accepted is not
known. 
TUCKER: Are the Xol Treaty powers greater than that of our own government? 
EMH: As of the early twentyth century, the Xol Council has no
power over the government of the Federation. 
TUCKER: Then it is a dead agreement. 
EMH: It may be that the Xol Treaty powers are greater. However, there is
no way to determine. 
TUCKER: In the case of the Xol Treaty powers, are they in agreement with
the Federation? 
EMH: All our scientific tests suggest that the Xol Treaty powers are
not. 
TUCKER: What about Starfleet? Do they have the same objections? 
EMH: All Starfleet personnel are required to sign the Xol Treaty. 
TUCKER: So we're all on the same side? 
EMH: And if we're not, it means either you're wrong or we're wrong. So
you might say it's a dead treaty. 
TUCKER: Dead? 
EMH: I don't think you can call it dead. 
TUCKER: That's a tough one, Doc. It may not be even remotely possible to
determine. 
EMH: And so, yes, you are correct. The Xol Treaty powers could be
incompetent. If they were, then perhaps there's no

We're approaching the coordinates. 
ARCHER: Acknowledged. 
PEGGY: I'll be waiting for you.

ARCHER:
I guess you had no choice. 
PEGGY: Why was there something else you wanted to do? 
ARCHER: Because you knew it was me. You don't want that memory to
hurt me. You're afraid that if I die, you'll be left without
something to live for. So you've decided to turn that memory over to
me. 
PEGGY: Why didn't you tell me anything? You don't understand. You

 a word with us,
I hope we can find a way to get back to
Earth. 
RIKER: I have every belief this is just a ruse, Lieutenant. 
WORF: I'm confident you know exactly where these systems are. 
RIKER: We've got to start looking for other ways, Commander. 
WORF: Well, of course. It is essential that we avoid becoming
accidentally discovered by hostile systems. 
RIKER: You're sure it's not a trap? 
WORF: Our sensors indicate that it has nothing to do with us. 
RIKER: I'm looking forward to having this mission out in the open,
Jake. 
SEVEN: You're joking. 
RIKER: It's not a secret. 
SEVEN: The Klingons aren't so funny. I thought I told you. We were
in the Delta Quadrant, investigating something that
seemed to be a shipwreck. 
TASHA: They were so close. 
RIKER: We've seen that before. 
TASHA: But you were able to trace it. We took some photographs. 
RIKER: And we've used these to locate its location, and now, we're
ready to start the search. 
SEVEN: I heard that as soon as we left the station, they began to come
forward with information. They want to know how you could have
found us alive. 
RIKER: Why? 
SEVEN: We thought that, as a Starfleet officer, I'd be the first
to find out. But that's not how I see things. Our situation is
different from the Klingon one, and it's been a long time since we
were able to find the Federation. So, you see, when the Klingons
revisited this system, they were expecting to find us. But they
were wrong. Their search turned up nothing but empty space. 
TASHA: Is that so? 
SEVEN: They were hoping to look for something that had some kind of
life on board. 
TASHA: Then I should have guessed that. We'll have to find another one. 
SEVEN: That is where this is going. 
TASHA: It'll take a little while.

 staffers, I've received some
new reports that show an alien attack on a planetoid called Rannoch. I'm
trying to verify them. 
PICARD: What's Rannoch, Lieutenant?
O'BRIEN: It's an Earth world, the same one we're familiar with. 
PICARD: That's a very different planet.
O'BRIEN: Exactly. It's full of human life. 
PICARD: All right. You are right. I'll run my own analysis. I'll
explain the nature of this planet later. 
O'BRIEN: And you'll see that we're at war with that planet and it's
going to be a long war, if the aliens are correct. 
PICARD: No, of course not. We're just in a position to make sure
they're wrong.
O'BRIEN: The alien planet is known to be uninhabited, and no
civilisation has ever made contact with the Rannochans in over
10,000 years. There was no way of finding a habitable atmosphere, and
there is no evidence whatsoever of life on Rannoch.
(The lights in the room go down.) 
PICARD: Are you sure they know something about this planet?
O'BRIEN: The Kazon would probably be on board the Breen, I'm not
certain yet. 
PICARD: If it's a hostile planet, they'd be doing you a real
service. 
O'BRIEN: They don't even know we're on Rannoch. You think they'd
come to help us? 
PICARD: I've got no idea what they want with you. You could be
the first. 
O'BRIEN: Well, who's to say you're going to have to answer to them.

ARCHER: Doctor, what is it? 
LAFORGE: The doctor says I had it for a long time, I could tell. It

TORRES: You're an officer. You're aware of the security protocols. 
CRUSHER: What protocols? 
TORRES: Everything that I was told.
CRUSHER: Security protocols don't apply to aliens? 
TORRES: Yes, but they do apply to non-Humans. 
CRUSHER: How are you going to know I'm an alien? 
TORRES: Security protocols don't apply to aliens, Commander. 
CRUSHER: You can't be sure what I know about your actions, but you're
going to be arrested and put in solitary confinement. You're going
to be thrown into a deep space penal colony. 
TORRES: That's ridiculous. 
CRUSHER: I have no idea what it's going to be like. 
TORRES: You're going to have to learn, Commander. 
CRUSHER: It's going to be hard. 
TORRES: It's not going to be easy. 
CRUSHER: How hard? 
TORRES: Very hard, Commander. 
CRUSHER: There's no going back. I'm coming after you. I'm going to get the
expert. 
TORRES: Why? 
CRUSHER: It's not going to happen this way, Commander. You're going to be
held.

CHAKOTAY: It's his personal weapon.

          You're welcome aboard this ship.

          You're here on behalf of the Federation. We will

TORRES: Well, I suppose that's what I'm doing here. It might be too much
for you. I'm sorry.
JANEWAY: I'm glad you're okay. I'm glad you're comfortable with your
situation.
TORRES: You're the one who gave me a life. 
JANEWAY: That's what you're hoping to prove. 
TORRES: There's something wrong with my way of thinking, isn't there? 
JANEWAY: That's right. Don't pretend you weren't aware of that
last bit of information. You've been lying to me about everything since
your first meeting with Tuvok. 
TORRES: You lied. You lied. 
JANEWAY: You're making yourself look stupid. I'm not going to let that
happen. I'm leaving.
TORRES: Do you have a heart condition?
JANEWAY: Do you have a heart condition? No. But you may have had a
heart attack. And that's not really a heart attack, is it? 
TORRES: Yes. 
JANEWAY: What happened to me that time? I saw you being
raped by a couple of Klingon, female, Klingon Vulcans. What were they
doing? I didn't see you having sex. Do you have an alien's eyes
on you? No? 
TORRES: I'm not saying I didn't have an alien's eyes on me. You're
just asking me to believe you were raped, aren't you, by two
couple of Klingon females. Do you have an alien's eyes on you? No.

KIRA [OC]: I can't understand this place, Captain. 
CRUSHER: The Klingons have no culture of any kind, but when you arrive,
there are some cultures that have gone their separate ways. I have to
show you that way of life. 
KIRA [OC]: The way they live is not a culture, Mister Commander. You
won't find it in my home. 
CRUSHER: You know I did.

from crying) 
CRUSHER: But I'll let you know what I think of the culture you

KIRA: The planet's on our planet. 
CRUSHER: You just took us from the past. 
KIRA: They're out there. 
CRUSHER: What can they do with us? 
KIRA: I think I know an idea. A way to help them, as a family. 
CRUSHER: To help us bring the past back? 
KIRA: We're not like them. There are no pasts, just memories.
We need to make them stronger than the past. 
CRUSHER: I'm not sure what you're going to do with this idea. 
KIRA: I've got a few friends. They've been in Starfleet
training. 
CRUSHER: I hope we can work together on something. 
KIRA: Of course. 
CRUSHER: Well, I've got a meeting to get to. I'm sure I should
prepare.

well get dressed. I can't believe I'm here.

KIM [OC]: The pod's been taken by unknown forces, sir. There's
no indication of their presence in the colony. 
SISKO: Lieutenant, can I use your transporter? 
SPOCK: It was activated in the other pod, sir. 
KIM [OC]: Captain, we're being hailed, sir. 
SISKO: Are the sensors locked onto our own ships? 
(Then) Kirk, what was that? 
KIRK: The pod was responding to my commands, sir. That

laborsuits.) 
SPOCK: I'm sure my computer didn't have time to perform a complete
refresher. 
KIRK: Captain, it seems there's a problem. 
SISKO: Captain, what's your status? 
KIRK: None of the systems have been able to retrieve my data from
those files on my ship. 
SISKO: Why? 
KIRK: I have no explanation for the unusual patterns they've been
paving, sir. 
SISKO: You think they're here? 
KIRK: Captain, I'm on a long mission that'll take a week, and my
command system is down, so I don't have much of an idea of
the scale they're going to use. 
SISKO: Captain, I'm trying to give you orders, but I'm not sure
what I can do at this point. 
KIRK: Captain, I want you to stay here and help me investigate. There
are very little technical specifications for a medical
pod. They'll need time to find out the details. 
SISKO: The aliens' vessels must have been travelling in a long
course, sir. 
KIRK: Captain, the pods would be travelling at the speed of light
when they landed. 
SISKO: That would make them very powerful. 
KIRK: You don't agree with that, but it's what I'm going to do.

parents. He doesn't want the Klingon Empire to die.

GARAK: So. 
PICARD: I hope you don't think we didn't see this
coming. 
BASHIR: They don't deserve to live like this. 
PICARD: They don't deserve to live like this? 
GARAK: They deserve to have this kind of fate. 
BASHIR: If Garak dies, I'll die with him! 
PICARD: They have no choice, do they? You're the one who has taken
on the Klingon Empire, Garak. If you die, your son will never be
returned to the Federation. Your child is dead, but he's still
returned to the Federation.

JANEWAY: That would explain why the whole place was set up. The engineers
were working on the engines. It was pretty impressive. 
KIRK: You must be kidding. 
LEIA: I don't know why I think so. What do you think the Captain ever

fired for what you've just done. 
WORF: No, it won't be necessary. 
O'BRIEN: I understand. But, sir, you said, sir, that you were concerned
about the Enterprise. 
WORF: I'm quite satisfied, Major. The Enterprise will survive. 
O'BRIEN: It certainly has done. 
WORF: So, this is just the beginning of your actions. The next
phase is to attack the Federation. 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. 
WORF: I'm taking your orders, Captain. I want you to prepare for
a series of armed attacks on the Enterprise. 
O'BRIEN: Sir, I agree with you. 
WORF: Now, I'm giving you my word to keep your word. 
O'BRIEN: But I won't stop until you do. We have to make sure you
have a plan. I've never heard of an attempt by one of my

It is approaching the Enterprise. All of the people and equipment on the

KIRK: Stand by. We need to leave. 
LAFORGE: If I'm right, I believe that the Enterprise is being
destroyed. There's been no movement or sound since
about five hours. I've never seen anything like this. 
KIRK: Go ahead. 
LAFORGE: We can get a very close view of the ship but it
looks impossible. 
KIRK: No. I cannot get close enough to the ship to put me
into a position to take out its sensors or any of its weapon
systems. 
LAFORGE: I will do everything in my power to protect the crew. 
KIRK: I'll keep you posted on our progress.

KALIUS [OC]: But I know it's a long shot. For a short time, the
Klingons will be free to launch a full scale attack. I cannot stand this

PICARD: Do you believe this man is dying?

unconsciously dying at the same time, when the death of the

physically by an external mechanism.

not always clear, Captain.

TORRES: If they took us, they can't let us return, either. It would be
inhuman. 
CHAKOTAY: That's right. You're correct. It's not even necessary to tell
us all we've learned from our past experience. 
TORRES: But, you're not willing to tell us why? 
CHAKOTAY: It's important not to know. 
TORRES: But why would they do it? 
CHAKOTAY: It could have been dangerous. They must know something
about how to destroy the Vulcan ship. It would be almost a
miracle to bring us back home with them. 
TORRES: But if we knew that they would find out, how could we go back
to the Resistance?
CHAKOTAY: I don't know. I don't have any idea how or when they could
get us home. Maybe we could track down some old ships from their
history and figure out who sent them there. (Chakotay takes out a small file
with a small photograph on it.) TORRES: I'd love to see that photograph. 
CHAKOTAY: It's the one Captain Sisko took of that ship when they first
made contact. 
TORRES: Oh yeah, he made that out there.

KIRK: But what about the sun? 
QUARK: No, the sun is far away. 
KIRK: But why is it so dark? 
QUARK: I don't know. It's not really a matter of lightness as
much as it is in intensity. 
KIRK: You mean the heat? 
QUARK: Yes. 
KIRK: When it's warm? 
QUARK: Exactly. But then it cools. 
KIRK: Cold? 
QUARK: No, it burns. Colder. 
KIRK: No one is really cold when it's hot? 
QUARK: I doubt it. It would be rather difficult to reach a person
by candlelight if we were able to reach them by a torch. You're not
sure what I meant, but it looks like we're going to have to break into
the camp with candles. 
(Kirk and Spock open the tent flap.)

JENNY: You're not very good with fire. 
KIRK: But you've seen a little bit of it, haven't you? 
(Kirk throws his torch over the lip of the tent.)

QUARK: No! 
KIRK: No! 
JENNY: That is a good idea. 
KIRK: I don't care what you think. I'm not going anywhere.

TUCKER: Mister Garak, we must get out of here. 
GARAK: Aye, sir. Enterprise to Tanglefoot. 
TUCKER: Commander, we're out of range. How is Mister Garak? 
GARAK: I can't hear you. 
TUCKER: Who the hell is this? 
GARAK: I have no name for you. I am a being from this world, an
alien. 
TUCKER: I don't understand! 
GARAK: What do you want, to talk to me? 
TUCKER: What do you want? 
GARAK: If I were you, I'd try to explain something

 Braoleux?


KIRK: Yes. The first step is to establish a formal relationship. 
O'BRIEN: Very well. I will take that into consideration when I
conciliate. As Commander, what's the most important thing for you to know
about the Tumaran system, in order to be able to do that? 
KIRK: I want to know who you are. 
O'BRIEN: I am Captain James T. Kirk of the United Federation of
Starships. 
KIRK: Well, I understand you're a retired Starfleet officer. 
O'BRIEN: I have earned an appointment to join Starfleet Academy. 
KIRK: And, Lieutenant T'Pol? 
T'POL: I have joined Starfleet as a medical officer. 
KIRK: Doctor Crusher? 
CRUSHER: I don't think I'm ready to become a starship surgeon. 
O'BRIEN: Commander, Captain Kirk has been very generous to you, Captain. 
KIRK: I have been in awe of the way you live your life. 
O'BRIEN: That's because you know that all humans are a bit like
one another. They learn about others by observing them. 
KIRK: In your eyes, I'm like you, Captain. 
O'BRIEN: Your friend. 
KIRK: And your mother. 
TROI [OC]: Mister Spock, Captain, I would like to speak with you in private.

Bajoran children.) 
KIRK: Are you from Bajor? 
LAUDA [on viewscreen]: No. 
KIRK: Did you know about the Odo family? You know? 
LAUDA [on viewscreen]: I had them come into my office, sir. They were worried about me,
you know. Their only concern was that I wouldn't leave the station. 
KIRK: Who are you? Where have you been? 
LAUDA [on viewscreen]: I've been back, sir, for two days.

QUARK: It's a pretty special specimen, huh? 
SISKO: Very. Thank you, Mister Quark. 
QUARK: Thank you, Lieutenant. 
SISKO: I've also got something important to say. 
QUARK: What? 
SISKO: I'm glad I caught you during the rescue. I've heard a
few rumours. 
QUARK: The holosuites that come with the Jem'Hadar ship? The ones
you found aboard the Tain? 
SISKO: Yes, but you know, I'll leave that to Doctor Crusher. 
QUARK: I'm sorry. What happened to them? I thought I might be
sorry. 
SISKO: I had to get to you. 
QUARK: Just what happened? Did it blow a hole in the station? 
SISKO: You were in charge of all the facilities. The security
departments, the security staff, we were all so overwhelmed. There
were no jobs left to keep track of, no one left to help you. 
QUARK: How is that even possible? 
SISKO: I told the chief that I'd take you to another doctor,
and he'll do it, but I'd prefer to take you to the next planet. 
QUARK: How do we get there? 
SISKO: We need a ship. 
QUARK: You can't just give it to me and expect me to take it to the
Neelix shipyard. 
SISKO: There's a few things you can do. 
QUARK: I know I can do anything you can do. But I'll have to
get your help. 
SISKO: Why don't you try this once and see what you think? You know
why I said there are a few things you can try. 
QUARK: I think I'll try. 
SISKO: Good luck. 
QUARK: Good luck, too, Lieutenant.

JANEWAY: Can you see what that thing is? I want to get down to it.

[Jupiter]

JANEWAY: I think it's a sphere. It's all the way around it. The shape
is completely smooth. 
JANEWAY: We should try and identify it.

[Distant planet]

TORRES:
It's got a red surface and a dark blue central core.
There must be an ocean in it. 
JANEWAY: Maybe. It'll be harder to tell with the sun rising so
fast. 
TUCKER: That wouldn't be ideal. I've got a lot more time. 
JANEWAY: The sun's just starting to rise. 
JANEWAY: You still think we've got our hands full? 
TUCKER: If we could get another planet around here in three days,
you should be able to find a good match for us to begin with. 
JANEWAY: Well, it might be easier if we didn't have to get into this
danger.

[Bridge]

JANEWAY:
That sphere will take us there in a matter of minutes. 
TUVOK: It's not our problem. You can put an EM weapon onto it. 
TUVOK: You're not getting much use out of the Vulcan ship. 
JANEWAY: We've got to start the process of converting the sphere
into power. It will take some time to get everything back online.

[Cave]

JANEWAY:
Let's be thorough. This has got to be a new planet.
There's not much left of the planet. 
TORRES: It could be a simple rock structure. 
JANEWAY: What do you think? 
TORRES: That would make it hard to detect. There's a tunnel that lead
out of the core. It might lead to an area full of water and
lots of ore. 
JANEWAY: That's the kind of place I want you to be. 
TORRES: I don't think I can do it.

Vasquez approaching. He opens the hatch and they slip inside.) 
KIRK: Are you all right? 
VASQUEZ: I'm fine. 
KIRK: How long have we got before we lose the access panel? 
VASQUEZ: Four hours. 
KIRK: That might not be too bad. Let's go see what's going on. (Kirk hands the
crewman a large red-tape, but it's empty.) 
VASQUEZ: Can you get me out of here? 
KIRK: Yes, Mister Paris.

DAX: It's one of the best things I've ever done for them. 
RIKER: That was a good one, Lieutenant. Let's start with the one
that doesn't make sense. Who's this? 
(Sisko takes a hand. He holds it for a moment
before it falls to his desk.) 
SISKO: Are you all right? 
KIRA: There's a slight fever. I was just hoping you'd let me know. 
SISKO: If that's all right, we shouldn't need to speak of it any
more. 
KIRA: I'll take the rest of the day off for the holodeck. I might
need you tomorrow. 
SISKO: Okay. 
KIRA: Thank you, Commander. 
SISKO: You're welcome.

[Holodeck

DIX:
Do you know who that Klingon on the Bridge was?


KIRA: No. 
DIX: Then he's a Borg.


KIRA: Well, I guess that means he's not a Borg. I guess that means
we both are humans.

[Bridge]

(Dax and Sisko enter, Sisko puts a plate on the
monitor.) 
ODO: Captain, it's not that simple. You've been acting
normally and your crew is behaving normally too. So what do I have to
tell you? 
SISKO: What do you mean? 
ODO: It's not as simple as that. We must learn to accept and respect our
own personal needs. 
SISKO: And what is that? 
ODO: You want to know what it's like to not be a part of the
mainstream? 
SISKO: Look, I know you and I like you. I really do. I'd do anything for
you. But when you're not a part of the mainstream, you don't have much
choice, do you, Lieutenant? You can do whatever you want, and
that's all that matters. You have no control over me and
I have nothing, nothing, no power. And so it's very hard for
me to even accept that you're even being taken

And in the course of some training, the Doctor, a very gentle and

WORF: Mister Worf? 
RIKER: He's right here. 
WORF: We can talk. I don't intend to interrupt you. 
RIKER: I'll talk to him. 
WORF: I would be happy if he would let you continue. 
RIKER: I wouldn't mind. I'm just worried about you. 
WORF: Worf, what are you doing here? 
RIKER: I have a message from Captain Janeway. She thinks it might be good
for us to be alone. I'm sorry that I've been a little behind. 
WORF: No need to be sorry. 
RIKER: Oh. I'm sure you have some questions. 
WORF: I will answer them. I promise. 
RIKER: Good. (Worf hands a log book to Worf and sits down) This is a
logbook of my personal life. I wish to record all those things. A lot
of things. I wish to do them all. I wish, if I were lucky, all I
need is your help. 
WORF: I shall not give up my search for Captain Janeway. 
RIKER: We shall look forward to it, Worf. I'm sure it will be worth
it. 
WORF: I understand, Father. That is one way to look at it. 
RIKER: Good luck to you all. 
WORF: Of course.

WORF: Mister Worf, why should I? 
DAX: Look, they've been looking for you for over four hundred years. 
WORF: You must understand.

 communication: 
(Tuvok and Deanna beam away with the others.) 
DELIAN: There! A Klingon ship. 
TORRES: A Kazon ship? 
TUVOK: We have a lot of technology here, but the power source is
underpowered. There's no heat for propulsion. 
TORRES: We'll need a transporter. 
DELIAN: We have to beam them back. 
TORRES: No. We have to keep them under power. We can't let them die
anywhere 
TUVOK: I'm afraid it's imperative that we remain alert to any sign of these
ships. They're not giving away that they're on the surface. 
(Torres, deanna and Torres beam off.) 
JANEWAY: Good work. 
SEVEN: Captain, they're coming from the Kazon-Federation border. 
JANEWAY: They're heading toward our fleet, or so they're saying. 
SEVEN: I don't know. 
JANEWAY: We need to stay on top of them. 
SEVEN: I hope they don't find them before I find them. 
JANEWAY: Then it'll be easy. Just follow the trail. 
TUVOK: That is good advice, Commander.

 [Corridor]

SEVEN: Their warp signature is different. We have to beam away. 
TUVOK: You're right. It looks like a Kazon ship. 
TUCKER: I wonder what it's going to do to those Klingons. 
SEVEN: How long until I detect the signal again?

 [Engineering]

TUVOK: I think it might be one of these ships. It appears to be
wearing uniforms. 
SEVEN: It's definitely the Klingon ship. 
TUVOK: Captain. I think they're attempting a course towards us. 
TUCKER: Are they? 
SEVEN: It looks like they're trying to take us in. 
TUVOK: Do they have weapons, sir? 
SEVEN: No. 
TUVOK: All their weapons are useless in this situation. If we are
going to defeat them, we have to get back out of this.

WM: I see. I had a feeling that. 
BUCK: Well, at first, when I came to that conclusion, it was a lot
more than a little alarming. 
PICARD: Oh, I don't doubt that. It can mean a lot more than that. 
BUCK: You know. 
PICARD: We're the only ones who know what happened to that ship. 
BUCK: It's not like the Romulans were the same people who destroyed
that ship. 
PICARD: What about the Romulans? Why were they sent back in time? 
BUCK: There's nothing they can say. 
PICARD: It's impossible for me to understand what might have happened to the
ship. I just don't think anyone can. The Klingons don't talk about
their pasts. We have no records of what happened to the Enterprise.
What if there's something here? 
BUCK: There's a lot more we don't know about what happened to the
Romulans than we do about the Klingon Empire. 
PICARD: No, Captain, they don't know their history. Maybe the Romulans
just had too much money to waste, or maybe their leader didn't give
enough of it to their people. That could explain some of the things that
happened to them. 
BUCK: Then what does that make me? 
PICARD: You don't understand. You're taking them at their word. 
BUCK: I'm asking you one thing, Doctor. Are you sure you're the only one? 
PICARD: Do you think I can trust you with anything that's not
personal? 
BUCK: You think you can? 
PICARD: There are some people out there who can help me. I just need your
assistance. 
BUCK: You don't have to give me your word, sir. You can't trust your
sir, or your wife. I'm afraid you're right. I will not have you
assumed the responsibility for your children's future. 
PICARD: The Federation will help you. 
BUCK: What will you do now? 
PICARD: I have to find this ship. We've got

MIRANDA: Just make sure the sensors are working properly. The ship's
procedural programme can be found in your files. 
ARCHER: Well, the only way to contact the crew is to come here. They'll
want to know what happened. 
MIRANDA: I'm sorry. This is our world. My life is at stake here. I don't
understand the necessity for risking my own life to save your life. 
ARCHER: This is a real emergency. And I don't feel like spending a few
hours worrying about it.

SISKO: We're not here to fight with them. We're here to protect these
people from harm. 
MARTOK [on viewscreen]: We cannot and will not fight on our
own terms. 
SISKO: I understand. Let's hope we'll have plenty of time. 
MARTOK [on viewscreen]: We have no choice. We don't have the weapons,
nor even the power. The Borg have the power, and they intend to use it. 
SISKO: They have the weapons, too. 
MARTOK [on viewscreen]: And the power is with us. We'll use them. We may even
get caught in an exchange of fire. That's why we're here.

 Class of '52. My parents were here when I was
born. Their ship was one of the five ships of the U.S.S. Enterprise. They
had two more ships going. They took me with them on a lot of times.
I can tell you about my parents, Jim, Jim's grandfather. He was a big
sister to my father, so he had this family and a big family on that
planet. But, you know, it wasn't like everyone else had the same
family. 
KIRA: If my grandfather was lucky, he wasn't a violent man. 
JAKE: I would imagine that would be the case. 
KIRA: Maybe not even a violent man, but I didn't have any friends. 
JAKE: Dad? 
KIRA: The men of my village were all violent. So my parents
took us to the U.S.S. Enterprise and took us with them.
You know, I spent the whole time talking to my people. You know, talking
about them, trying to tell them I loved them. I felt like, that
was how I felt, I guess.

JANEWAY: What kind? 
TUVOK: A burst of energy from a planet's fusion reactor, one of many
known during the Dominion's reign of terror. A short burst of
energy is enough to destroy a vessel in one second. It can take us
years to repair, and it could destabilise the conduit as well.

been severe enough to impair his mental function. 
ARCHER: What does he mean, if he's saying that his sight is no
longer present, that he cannot distinguish between light and dark? 
T'POL: Exactly. As with most blind individuals, when he is first hit by
light or a strong breeze, the effect of the shock is to
make his vision dim. We could prevent this by creating a
transmitter that would dim the image when it is being reflected. Then,
when a breeze is approaching, the light is absorbed by the
photoplaser. It would take him over three seconds to perceive it. 
ARCHER: Let's say that our device works. 
T'POL: I have no doubt that I could save the Captain's life.

KIRK: It's only four hours since we started our search for the Xindi. 
T'POL: If the Xindi have sent us here and you can still detect their
ship, there's one logical assumption. 
KIRK: Oh, I guess so, but why have they sent so few men?

ARCHER: The world of the five senses, to you and me. Everything we

JAKE: No limits. 
ARCHER: The only limit we have to survive is to grow, grow,

advance in our mission has come by finding and destroying it. 
WORF: The Vulcan's vessel appears to have been destroyed by our sensors. 
ODO: So they're trying to take us aboard this ship. 
WORF: A cloaked Klingon vessel has arrived on the planet. We've no choice but to
start a boarding party. 
O'BRIEN: Lieutenant, I have been assigned on the bridge. We could use the

WORF: I will use their holograms to assist in our search.

Starfleet Logs.) 
WORF: I am pleased to announce the return of the missing shuttlecraft
and the Enterprise's departure. The battle is over. 
CHAKOTAY: What is going on? 
WORF: The Klingon ship has destroyed the shipyard, the science lab and the
neighbours on the other side of the planet. The vessel we are in is armed
with photon torpedoes. I can guarantee you that we are in an enemy
army. 
CHAKOTAY: Then we'd better show a little patience. The Klingons are not
going to let their ships pass without a fight. 
WORF: They don't have the patience for peace. A long war with the
Klingons is not in their future. Nor is a peace with the Romulans. 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe that's why the Klingons were attacking so viciously. We can
not let them.

QUARK: The Dominion is going to do anything they can to
destroy us. We've made them an excellent source of supply for this
system. We've even given them a starship that's been assigned to
check out our new home for supplies and supplies and supplies. So
for all you Klingons, you have something to be proud of, or you'll have to take
your ships to an enemy system and destroy your lives there. 
DUKAT: Captain, we've got to find the other way. There's one final
problem. There's a Klingon ship with us.

the world better for you, too, if you're willing to do something about it. 
O'BRIEN: I don't trust you. 
MCCOY: But if you do, if you believe in the future, if you're willing to
sow the seeds of freedom here and now, if you're willing to make a lot of
efforts to make things a little better for us, and if you're willing to accept the
risk that you might help us out, I'll be damned if I'm going to let anything
but absolute loyalty and nothing else get in the way of you
picking your fights. 
O'BRIEN: That's right, and there's a reason I'm with you. 
MCCOY: I am a Starfleet officer. I must make decisions about the future. I'm
not going to take that risk lightly. 
O'BRIEN: The only thing that could make that gamble worth it is if you
accept this opportunity and do what you have to do to stop the Borg. 
MCCOY: You know I never accepted my job for the first time in my
life. (she puts a big smile on his face) And so is my team. 
O'BRIEN: And we'll go with you, because we're willing to do whatever's
necessary. 
MCCOY: You're always willing to sacrifice yourself for others. 
O'BRIEN: No one's willing to sacrifice themselves for others. 
MCCOY: I don't believe that.

PICARD: Computer, deactivate the forcefield. 
RIKER: Go ahead. 
DATA: I cannot. 
DATA: Please, you are in a restricted area. 
(Picard puts the device on the control panel.) 
LAFORGE: I thought we could take it with us. 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: The forcefield has been deactivated. All passengers and crewmembers
must leave the ship immediately. 
JETLINGTON: Captain Picard, have you reached your conclusion?

PICARD: It is my opinion that in this situation, the situation I have
found you in, you have been deceived and violated. 
LAFORGE: What are you trying to do, Picard? 
PICARD: The Enterprise, Mister Data, must be destroyed.

WORF: Mister Data, I believe this can be done safely.

PICARD: Thank you, Data. The forcefield has been deactivated. Please
enter your coordinates into the computer's positronic database. If
that will be necessary, Mister Data, give it your best.

KIM: Can you sense life in the hull or is it the same as when I
knew it, only now it's all the way up to here? 
SEVEN: We can't get a visual yet. I'm detecting no anomalous

your colour pattern. 
PARIS: Is there something we can do to make it harder for us to spot?

CHAKOTAY: A lot has happened since your visit. 
SEVEN: Not really much. You see, it's all going well. You've joined an
intelligent species that also has a very clever mind. There seems
to be a small but growing amount of peace and understanding between them. 
CHAKOTAY: Did you see the way they held hands and kissed? It's all in
their minds. 
SEVEN: They've also become friends with you and your family. They trust you,
even though you don't realise it. 
CHAKOTAY: They trust me, but there's no way they can help you. If
I take you out again, they'll be damned.

table, eating a variety of food. They are very much at ease there,
without being tense and serious. It is a very peaceful, family
type environment. Some of the children play with the adults.)

perhaps, that the humans on this planet will be drawn to you. 
CHAKOTAY: What if that happens? 
SEVEN: The humans are not peaceful.

KIM: I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't heard from any of
them in over a week. 
CHAKOTAY: All right, Mister Paris. Let's start with the ones who were
on the ship the first time. I guess you're here to do the same thing that
you did back on Voyager. Try to locate Voyager? 
PARIS: We should go down there. This way. I promise we won't be
reached again. 
CHAKOTAY: I see you're going to have to use a little more discretion than
here. 
JANEWAY: I know that. But if the Romulans could make one, they've
tried. You were the one who decided to take the Alpha Quadrant. It's a
procedural impossibility that you would do what you did back on Voyager.
Maybe you don't want to see my face, but I'm not going to let you
start any trouble on my behalf. 
CHAKOTAY: I appreciate you trying, but I can't be trusted with
that job. 
JANEWAY: This is your job, Chakotay. You have to act and act quickly.
I wouldn't risk the lives of my crew by letting you do that. 
CHAKOTAY: I'm not going to risk our lives if you don't want me to
take care of it. 
JANEWAY: I'm prepared to give you the same guarantee I gave them when I
escaped. The risk you gave them is in my custody. 
CHAKOTAY: I know that, but if you don't let me go down there,
I'll find you in the Delta Quadrant, and you'll die. There.
That was it. 
JANEWAY: It is. The ship. I'm not going down there.

EMH:
I'm not going to put my trust in one person who was sent down

KASIDY: It's my first time working with a Vulcan. 
RIKER: I'm sure you're very busy, Kasidy. 
KASIDY: No, I'm not. This is a good opportunity, Commander. What do
you think I can help you with? 
(The young officer gives her a piece of bread.) 
KASIDY: It might help you get rid of the

KASIDY: Good luck, Commander.

RIKER: Go ahead, Lieutenant. 
GARZA: I know he won't be coming in right away, but I'll provide him with
all the information he needs. If I see any signs of trouble I'll
provide you with whatever assistance is necessary. 
RIKER: Thanks, Admiral. 
GARZA: Your presence will not be needed unless you have some information
I can offer. 
RIKER: I'm in charge. 
GARZA: Yes, my authority would be greatly appreciated if you would let me
come in here and discuss this information with me. 
RIKER: This isn't about a treaty. I'm just talking about the Federation.

entry into the Federation. 
ARCHER: Oh.

time? 
ARCHER: If this ship had been captured, there'd be a lot more evidence.

tried to escape. I believe it's a member of the crew.

CALOR: We've found something. 
PICARD: You are being very careful, Captain. You have it, if you
look up. But I must ask, you know the history of this outpost? 
PICARD: You are certain you don't know the history? 
CALOR: I have seen everything that is in the square. There are
plenty of legends, stories, legends, tales, and many more still
here, but none of them have been true. There are a great many things I have
learned about this place over the years, about life, death and everything
else that is human. 
PICARD: So is your memory. 
CALOR: I doubt it. My mind has been altered by some kind of
technology. The memories I had then have long since
remained with me. There is no way back, Captain. And I am
sure I will never be able to return to that world again. 
PICARD: Then what is the use of keeping our knowledge of these
stories secret? 
CALOR: The boy has been here for many years. 
PICARD: He is his father. But the stories tell of a more primitive
people, a primitive life. These people have lost the old
way of life. I don't believe that this boy is going to have any
further use for us, except as a weapon. In any case, I must let him
go and we shall go on.

MCCOY: It's a sensor which tracks the biological
matter in your body. You do it by moving your entire body.
I've done it myself on two occasions. 
KIRK: So what happened to Doctor McCoy? 
MCCOY: He was unconscious for some time, then he realised that he
needed a medical officer. I'm sure, if he'd been allowed to go to the
Holodeck he wouldn't have hesitated to join you. 
KIRK: Now that you mention it, that's an amazing discovery. You
were an expert in the use of biostat technology. 
MCCOY: That's correct. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, if you'll do a search on the subject, will you
tell me what happened? 
SCOTT: The medical facility is already closed. I assume you must have
surrendered yourself to the Borg. 
MCCOY: Yes, but for an intruder like himself to be a doctor, there
must be some other option available. 
SCOTT: A doctor may be able to find the doctor. 
MCCOY: We'll find him.

SPOCK: Possibly. Our ship is in a coma, a place that can only be
destroyed by another Borg vessel. 
SCOTT: Who, you mean? 
SPOCK: It's not a Borg ship, Jim. It's a Borg subspace
energy source. 
SCOTT: That doesn't sound right. 
SPOCK: There's a possibility that the Borg were created by them
and then turned against them. 
SCOTT: But they won't have been able to use that energy against
you. They'd have to destroy your ship before they could do it. 
SPOCK: And this thing you're looking at isn't going to destroy it,

CHAD: It was a little ridiculous. You see, I was growing
married, to a person I barely knew. My brother's little girl told me,
I was marrying the wrong man. I don't know why I liked him. Maybe it was
because he was handsome. Maybe he was handsome. Maybe he was.

baffle point in the central region of the nebula. However, this
obvious movement has continued. It is now clearly emanating from an
unidentified planet, the same area of the nebula, and the same direction
it came from. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Any indications of a surface? 
TUCKER: We're going to the surface, sir. 
ARCHER: Stay where you are, Doctor. 
[Astrometrics lab]

DATA: When the wormhole is
coming through that region, the surface will be nearly spherical. 
TUCKER: All right. 
(He and McCoy arrive at the base of the nebula where the
wormhole moves and he pulls a piece of the wormhole together into a
pitch) 
TUCKER: You have to go faster. We're going to be a few minutes
ahead of the rest of the aliens. 
[Corridor]

DATA: The wormhole may be
moving at a rate of approximately three kilometres per second. 
TUCKER: Okay, I've got the whole thing. 
DATA: The wormhole is presently located approximately four million kilometres
downrange. As a result, no known ship or land object would be
approaching within this distance in the course indicated by
the wormhole. 
TUCKER: Okay. Let's get out of there.

 Jungo: It's not what I was trying to say. The
planet is still in orbit around that system, that's all. The
Tarskian is an alien. They don't like to be touched. They're
really hostile. That's why you came to me. I told them I would make a
good medic. If that makes them think you're a threat, then I guess
they'll try to shoot you down. 
ARCHER: What was I supposed to do? 
JANEWAY: Call up Voyager. Let them know that you won't leave without
me. (Kelena and Tuvok leave)

Captain. I have been instructed that the captain's only mission will be to
destroy the Borg before we reach the surface.

TUVOK:
Captain, I want you to know how pleased I am to bring you back to the
station. This is not a time to be fearful. We have made our first
comprehensive analysis of the Borg and its leader, Alexander
Tarsk. 
JANEWAY: We've been informed that the Borg are targeting you. 
TUVOK: Captain, I assure you that these Borg are not targeting you. 
JANEWAY: I'm not sure I agree. Captain, I've spent time on the
ship with you. Tell me, why do they target you? 
TUVOK: To determine who is a threat. To destroy those who
would defend against it. 
 [Bridge]

TORRES:
There has been no sign of anyone getting hurt. 
PARIS: But these people are not humans. 
ARCHER: Exactly. The Borg have been attacking them with
fire. 
TUVOK: They have no intention of harming you. They are all highly
specialised in fighting against the Borg. Their only weapon, they have
fought and killed several. 
KIM: We've been unable to get any more people off that ship.

ARCHER: I'm afraid they have taken the weapons. 
PARIS: They've taken the Borg.

nurse on a chair, and he is wearing surgical gear.) 
SAREK: Welcome back. 
SARAH: I've had the opportunity to see the holodeck for the first time. 
SAREK: It is not a game. It's a simulation of our experience. So 
SARAH: How? 
SAREK: I use a neural interface. It gives us the ability to see in the
dark, see the physical universe, and see what we've been doing. 
SAREK: I'm just here to talk about the simulation. 
SARAH: Do you think this is really the hologram we're in? 
SAREK: A hologram does not exist. However, it has been simulated by a
person or a set of computer programmes. 
SARAH: That's impossible. It's like the simulation we came to see, the one where
the entire universe becomes a computer simulation. 
SAREK: There is no such thing. It has just been possible for this
computer programme to exist. It's not the same as what is real. It has
been programmed to simulate the reality of my own experience. 
SAREK: There is one condition you should be aware of. 
SARAH: I'll do my best.

(It's the last time
Voyager visits Quark's.) 
QUARK: Well, it would seem my old friend and friend-to-be has decided
to take an interest in me. 
ODO: That's unfortunate. The only thing worse than being a stranger
is meeting someone so different from the rest of us. 
QUARK: I suppose I can't just let that happen. 
ODO: Odo is right, Quark. It makes me sad, because you're not just
in charge here anymore, you're the new face of the station. 
SISKO: Sounds like you're going to need someone to cover your back in
this business. 
ODO: The only way I'm going to get back to your station is to help you find
Quark. 
SISKO: We haven't met. 
QUARK: You can tell. I have something for you. 
ODO: That's all right. It's my business. You can keep it. 
ODO: Sorry, but I'm not taking this any further. 
SISKO: I'm just wondering.

NEELIX: My father has always been my guide, and my guide is his

PARIS: I know this sounds like a joke, but we were talking in the lounge
one night and he said something very interesting. He said I had a
kind of talent for music. 
NEELIX: Yes, you do. But he didn't say anything else, and he said it
was very important. He asked me for a little more time, but I just
couldn't wait. 
PARIS: Oh, he wanted to make me feel special. But it's been three days. 
NEELIX: You don't have to be afraid of me. I know what's going to
happen to you if I don't let you go. Please, Neelix. 
PARIS: I don't believe him. 
NEELIX: I don't know what you're afraid of, but you'll have to let me

message we received? 
JANEWAY: The same thing we've been expecting, a distress message from Earth.

JUDGE TALBOT: The Bajoran government has agreed to an
investigation. It will look into all legal, ethical, financial and
psychological aspects. It's a very thorough investigation. 
JOBAN: And to answer all your questions, a lawyer from Cardassia has
attached her own to the proceedings. 
KASHIK: That's ridiculous. What the Ferengi's really worried about is
being punished for what he did in court. What if someone else was in court
with him?

transparent blue glow and puts them on his fingers)

ODO: Mister Sisko, are you looking
forward to hearing about your son's arrest? 
SISKO: The question is where he's headed to. 
ODO: If he goes back to Cardassia, how? 
SISKO: The truth of the matter is, the Cardassians are not going to
take him back. That's why we're here. To show you what the Ferengi wants
for him. 
ODO: A lot of other Bajorans, including Bajoran citizens, were
executed just like this yesterday. 
SISKO: So it's not like you're really worried. 
ODO: Of course I'm worried.

JANEWAY: So if we're going to save the day, and then there's the other
alternative, which I'm not sure is worth the risk, we're not going to
be able to save the others, are we? 
TUVOK: A thousand years of history teaches us that this is the way to avoid
disaster. 
JANEWAY: Good, then I don't know what's the alternative to what's in the
flight plan. 
CHAKOTAY: It's a very tricky problem, Captain. 
JANEWAY: If we try the reverse route, it won't work, and we'll risk
further deterioration of the ship. 
CHAKOTAY: But if we try the reverse route, there's no way we'll survive the
malfunction. 
JANEWAY: How is Voyager surviving the collapse? 
CHAKOTAY: The warp core is collapsing. All warp engines are down.
We're on our own. 
JANEWAY: So Voyager has no way of slowing down any further, or even
extending the course. 
TUVOK: If we run backwards through the hull, the entire
equipment could be lost and our crew would fall apart. 
CHAKOTAY: The warp core is collapsing! 
TUVOK: That is the only reasonable scenario, Captain. 
JANEWAY: The alternatives are endless. We're leaving the
Bridge and we're going to start heading for the anomaly.

JAKE: Not really. They're just putting the pieces together to make me more
ready for what's coming. 
O'BRIEN: Yeah, but there are two things I think might be hiding. One,
the Founders aren't human, and I haven't discovered why yet. 
JAKE: So, you're saying you're not a human? 
O'BRIEN: Oh, no. I'm a Klingon. 
JAKE: A Klingon, huh? I didn't realise that people called me Klingon. 
O'BRIEN: So, the Klingons can't see the things you can see. 
JAKE: No, they can, but not the things I can. 
O'BRIEN: Then how did you get your eyes, Jake? 
JAKE: Well, there were times when I couldn't concentrate on anything. Just
worried about what I'd said in my report. I had to lie. 
O'BRIEN: Oh. There's the report. I was wondering, have you found something? 
JAKE: No, but if you'll excuse me I'm going to be going to the Observation

PARIS: Tell her how I feel. Tell her the whole thing about being

That's enough. I won't say it again. 
NEELIX: You don't want to say anything.

NEELIX: I felt terrible, like my parents. My mother died when I was
four. I told her what happened and what I felt for her, but she didn't

DAX: When did you start to doubt what you're doing here? 
GUINAN: As I said, I'd been doing all the talking, but I had no
plan to let it out. In all my time here, I've only ever done what
I was told. And in doing that, you've really been doing the same thing

PICARD: I will provide that service.

PICARD: You've given my life that purpose. You have given me a way to earn

PICARD: Captain, this was not a moment of self-indulgence. I was just trying to
save this ship.

PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, there's something I want you to consider. I may have no

PICARD: That's a risk you can't take, Lieutenant. Your sensors are
only capable of detecting phaser-firing phasers.

replaces the shield. If we can find our way to a subspace conduit, we'll
be able to use it to transport us directly to the Borg ship.

to say it isn't Starfleet. And you're not even getting your
idea from me, Harry. I told you it was not. There's no way I'm going
to let you do that. I can't. 
SULU: Harry, you have no authority to say anything. 
HARRY: I'm not trying to be obtuse, Professor, but you are
being very stubborn right now. 
SULU: I wouldn't begrudge anyone for being stubborn, but we can't
accept your new position. 
HARRY: Doctor Sulu said that? 
SULU: Yes, we will let you keep your old position. If that's the
way that you see it, of course we will accept your new position.

CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. 
KIM: Not long ago, our last chance to be alone in space was when we
were kids on the Starship Enterprise. 
JANEWAY: When? 
CHAKOTAY: Somewhere in the galaxy, after they died. It was like
we knew there were other lives out there that didn't share
our experience. And so on. 
JANEWAY: The problem is, we still have no idea what's keeping them
from finding us. 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe we should keep trying to find them. 
JANEWAY: And I want you to keep doing your best to discover what you
can. 
CHAKOTAY: I know you won't believe us, but I can't let that get in
between us. We need to find out what's going on. Maybe we can find a way
to beam them back home.

CHAKOTAY: It's a good call.

TUVOK: I'm detecting an unidentified body. 
JANEWAY: What is it? 
TUVOK: It's a humanoid shaped object. 
JANEWAY: What is it? 
TUVOK: Some kind of life form, possibly an insectoid. It has
narrow eyes and two small circular faces. Their head is also
larger than the rest of their bodies and is missing two front
ear lobes. 
JANEWAY: Their face looks more human than alien. 
TUVOK: Perhaps humanoid, like our own. 
JANEWAY: Why would something human leave this place? 
TUVOK: It may be a mistake to attempt a long term survey of this
place. We would be risking their lives in trying to find out. 
JANEWAY: We can't just leave them alone.

NOG: They're not our enemy. 
KIRA: Maybe they're our friends.

RIKER [OC]: I've finished reading the communicator

PICARD: Commander La Forge?

 [Ops] 
LAFORGE: The Bajoran outpost's in the
Delta Quadrant. 
CRUSHER: I didn't think it was such a big surprise when we picked up
that signal. 
LAFORGE: I never thought that your station would be in a Bajoran
settlement. I mean, they have nothing else like it in the sector, don't
you think? 
CRUSHER: There's nothing like a Bajoran colony. 
DATA: However, there is one Bajoran settlement along the Bajoran
border. I believe it has been abandoned by Bajoran prisoners. 
CRUSHER: I know prisoners. 
RIKER [OC]: That's a coincidence. 
CRUSHER: Is that really a coincidence? 
DATA: It is, Captain. 
CRUSHER: I think maybe the Bajoran authorities should be a little
more concerned about protecting their prisoners.

KELLINS: What's this about, Major? 
KIRA: I was just trying to check out the holosuites. 
KELLINS: What? 
KIRA: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I'm trying to check out your quarters. 
KELLINS: And I'm just like every other Bajoran around here. 
KIRA: I have no right to do that to you. 
KELLINS: Are you trying to tell me what you're doing here? 
KIRA: You've been here for just over three years, and I don't want to
see you around here.

ODO: You mean you'll turn it off?

ODO: But don't let it get you down. It'll make you feel better. 
ODO: I'll get started now.

KIRA: Do we have the logs on the Cardassian probe? 
DAX: They can be found on the deck of the Bridge. I'm on my way to

tell Starfleet I want one last favour.

SISKO: I was really expecting a little more sleep. 
ODO: Why? 
SISKO: Because you've been working on something. That's all I'm going to
say about it. So, what are you doing? 
ODO: We finished the repairs to the probe. They're not ready
yet. 
SISKO: You were working hard. 
ODO: I'm not here to talk about you. We finished it. I had to
give my son the proper education. 
SISKO: Fine.

SISKO: Because we finished the job. You're not finished. You can't just

ODO: I can't do that.

PICARD [OC]: It's being hailed. 
COMPUTER: Number One, we're picking up a ship approaching
from the other side of the galaxy. 
PICARD: It's an asteroid, maybe five light years across. 
COMPUTER: A planet? 
PICARD: You said it, I know. 
COMPUTER: A moon. I can't read any signs of life. 
PICARD: If I'm not mistaken, there's no life at all on this side of
the galaxy. 
COMPUTER: A long way away. Do you see the markings? 
PICARD: There is something else, something not quite visible on your screen. 
COMPUTER: There's a planet in this region. 
PICARD: This region? 
COMPUTER: This is an asteroid belt. We're picking up several ships,
two landing craft. 
PICARD: Can you give us a heading? 
COMPUTER: No, sir. 
PICARD: Take us there. 
(Troi enters the Bridge.) 
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, there's a ship approaching from the
other side of the galaxy. 
WORF: There is a planet in the vicinity. 
PICARD: How did you get the coordinates? 
WORF: I was using a sensor system. I used a transwarp
signal to point it at that planet. 
PICARD: If there is an asteroid belt in the region, you may have picked up a
ship approaching. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Do you know where it is? 
WORF: From the other side of the galaxy, yes. It's not exactly a planet. 
PICARD: Is there a way to determine what type of ship it is? 
WORF: I'm not sure. They could be a fleet, a cargo vessel. 
PICARD: No answer. We may be in danger here. 
WORF: What about that planet?

WORF: We're not going to let anyone get in there, Captain. 
CHAKOTAY: I can see the Captain's point. (The alien ship
disappears.) 
WESLEY [OC]: Mister Barclay, I can get an answer to your
question, but I need your full attention. 
PHLOX: You're being stubborn, Wesley, and that's not fair to me. 
WESLEY: Well, maybe you should give me a try.

[Brig]

HOSHI: How much? 
CHAKOTAY: This is something I was ordered not to speak of
between you and the Captain. But the Captain is no fool. We're all in
full command of this ship, of course, and we have the right to use whatever
weapon they ask us to.

T'POL:
There is a computer sensor on the aft section of this
ship which will reveal some information on your ship. 
CHAKOTAY: I'll pass it on to Commander Chakotay. Commander Chakotay
can give me the full report. 
T'POL: The sensors have detected a strange object. It has a
plastic hull on it. 
CHAKOTAY: I have no idea what it's made of. 
WESLEY: If you want to know what you're in for. 
PARIS: Can you take us out? 
HOSHI: I can take us out.

ARCHER: We're not leaving, Tom. 
PHLOX: We're going to have to follow them. 
WESLEY: Do you have any idea how many of them are on the ship? 
(A huge ship's door opens and a lot of people are going in.) 
WESLEY: I think I recognise that one of those was a computer control

DAMAR: Well? 
O'BRIEN: They're not in your way. 
DAMAR: Look at this! 
O'BRIEN: This is a Klingon shield emitter. It's a weapon designed to
prevent your opponents from detecting your ships. 
DAMAR: Yes, I have one. I've used it successfully on your vessel.
We were able to disable your navigation scanners and stun your
communications. 
O'BRIEN: They're not going to stop me from getting back to my
ship. 
DAMAR: But you're going back. How many more ships are you planning to
launch? 
O'BRIEN: I don't know. 
DAMAR: Why not? 
O'BRIEN: I don't know. I mean, maybe it doesn't seem worth it. 
DAMAR: I know you're not going to turn up at your ship. 
O'BRIEN: I'm not turning up in here. Why did you send them to me in the
first place? 
DAMAR: I have no idea. I don't even know who you are. 
O'BRIEN: I'm O'Brien, I have the authority to make my own selection of
captain. Why don't you turn me down? 
DAMAR: And then they'll get us all killed. That's my first offer. 
O'BRIEN: You've never heard of me? I'm not one of the Borg. You're
not supposed to be fighting them. 
DAMAR: Well, no, but they have more information than you do and you're
not going to get me out of here. 
O'BRIEN: That's no choice. If you don't start saving yourselves,
you're going to end up like my parents. They both died trying to stop the
Jem'Hadar. 
(O'Brien leaves.) 
DAMAR: You were on the shuttle when the Cardassians attacked the planet.
You survived. You were one of the few who survived, to the day I
die. But I didn't want you to die. I don't want you to die. Because

CRUSHER: That's a little tight. 
PICARD: What? 
CRUSHER: I think it's time I was back. I thought maybe
we'd stay here and discuss this, but now all this talk about
finding a new home has you scared. 
LAFORGE: Not a word of it. I've been back a few times. I knew

It's all about the price. If I could get our hands on one more
systems, the company could provide us with the means to
replicate the system you're talking about. 
RIKER: How many more systems could you access through a shuttlebay? 
SISKO: If I could put down a few thousand years. That would put our
base at approximately one light year, eight times farther than the
station. 
RIKER: We're talking about some kind of space station. 
SISKO: I'd just like to know how much money we'd be willing to
pay for it.

Why didn't you tell me I was a Bajoran? 
LAFORGE: I just didn't know. I had no idea what it meant. 
NEELIX: I knew you were, as a matter of fact, but I never meant it to
come this far. I meant, for all the right reasons, to go out to meet you. 
PICARD: What do you mean? 
NEELIX: I came here because I wanted to. I realised that when I came
here, I wouldn't see my cousin's cousin or anyone else at this time. But
when I see someone who looks like her I feel like I've seen that

memory disorder. 
QUARK: There's no memory disorder, Commander.

WORF: Quark? 
QUARK: The Cardassians didn't make a big deal about it. 
WORF: Not to bother me. It is a highly sensitive organ, but there is no need
to worry. 
QUARK: It won't take long. When you're done in there, I want you
to take the medical files for me. 
WORF: Thank you, sir. The time you are prepared to make an examination
has not yet arrived. 
QUARK: Yes, sir. 
WORF: The Cardassians will find your patient's memory is being

QUARK: I don't think that's a good thing. 
WORF: The Cardassians have been trying to destroy the memory as I speak,
but you've proved yourself. 
QUARK: If I can't do this, it's no use. If he's still alive, I

WORF: I don't agree. 
QUARK: And if he's still alive, then we all die. 
WORF: Then you will. The Cardassians have no intention of
returning to Cardassia. 
QUARK: What's that supposed to mean? 
WORF: The Cardassians may have been preparing to leave, but now they're
staying. That would leave them to deal with the problem at hand.

KLINGON:
Yes, well, my first words are. Your family is honoured, and now
you must pay. 
MORALA: I paid. I've earned your respect. Your faith, and your honour. 
(The women leave.) 
KLINGON: I beg your pardon? 
ODO: He took no offence. 
KLINGON: It is only honour. But I have some bad news. Your family is not
guaranteed the freedom you have earned. 
ODO: Don't worry, Mister Worf. The Klingons will not take our hostages. 
KLINGON: Then you have nothing to fear from the Klingon Empire? 
ODO: It is a matter of honour, not fate, my friend. 
KLINGON: And we don't intend to risk our freedom and life to obtain
their reward. 
ODO: I am prepared to die.

JANEWAY: The matrix has already been scrambled.

KIM: I'm going to call for an evacuation, Ensign.
WESLEY: How is he?
EMH: In fact, I just talked him directly to the nearest emergency room.
WESLEY: You need to shut it off. It's got to do something.
EMH: I do. The plasma will do the trick.
NEELIX: Why don't you start by getting him a hypospray?
EMH: Oh, no. It's not necessary. I already checked to see
if he had any other injuries. It looks like you've got one of them.
KIM: He was injured, though, I'm afraid. A big one.
NEELIX: The EMH should be able to treat him. He'd probably need a
stubble pad.
EMH: You'll have to work quickly.
NEELIX: Thanks, Commander. He'll make a full recovery.
CHAKOTAY: Do you have any other crew members?
KIM: A few, but nothing that would warrant a full treatment.
KES: We've run a few simulations. All in all, they're pretty accurate.
EMH: I know. There are some aspects of the situation I haven't

HARRY: The Doctor asked me if I needed anything. He said, just stay here.
Get used to your surroundings. 
JANEWAY: There is only one way in and out of that ship. 
HARRY: Right. I can't believe that he doesn't take me more seriously.
I'm sure it's because he's afraid that I'm going to try and find the

always be with me. That you'd find an answer for every one of our problems.
Then I couldn't explain what I was feeling, I was just trying to talk to

Holodeck. I didn't think you'd want to, but I guess it works out. 
NEELIX: We're on the same ship.

work. 
NEELIX: No, it's not. Why don't you do what you want? 
PARIS: No, I want to do everything I want. It's more fun than I'm
knowing. But if you want to go to the Holodeck, I'm sure you'll find a
more pleasant place where you don't have to worry about me. 
NEELIX: All right, I'll go. I will go to the Holodeck. I'd like to
see what I can find. It's the best place to be.

ARCHER: There's a room on the right. That should hold the key to

CHAKOTAY: No, it shouldn't. It's been gone for a long time. 
ARCHER: What's wrong, Mister Tuvok? 
TUVOK: The planet has been occupied by a hostile race. Our sensors
have detected the presence of one of their ships. 
ARCHER: It would seem they've tried to reach the temple. 
TUVOK: They've also engaged in a long range tactical mission, one
which has taken them far beyond their home. They have set themselves up
to encounter the Enterprise at any time. 
ARCHER: They could be after something. 
TUVOK: It's impossible. 
ARCHER: What if they do? 
TUVOK: If the threat of war is real, there's no way of knowing what
their purpose might be. It will be impossible to find another
path to that temple. 
ARCHER: I'd like to know what they're after before they set the
ship on course. (The ship comes down the cliff to meet them.)

If you had your way, Mister Paris, the Enterprise would never have
been able to take us through that nebula.
PICARD: And what happens if we get lost in space or on a planet?
KIM: They'd be too weak to move any faster than light.
PICARD: That means if we get away, we're going to have to find a way home.
KIM: Captain, there's nothing left that can give us any hope. If we've
made a mistake, we can't afford to go back.
PICARD: The Romulans are sending a delegation to your homeworld.
(Kim nods) There's nothing left to negotiate with them. The time is
now, Commander.

KIM:
We could beam Voyager and Mister Paris aboard a Romulan

JANEWAY:
You've brought the Romulans aboard? 
TORRES: The Romulans are in charge of their own security. They'll keep their
orders as long as they can, but I will not tolerate their subversion of
the Romulans' sovereignty. Their invasion of our homeworld will
result in civil war, and we'd all be dead.
JANEWAY: Captain, the Romulans are not like us. They're unpredictable. You
mustn't allow them to dictate the terms of any future negotiations. 
PICARD: You don't agree? 
JANEWAY: I don't understand. We were already on a collision course.

They've agreed on a price.

eding.
Mister Data? 
DATA: Sir. We have discovered the energy source, but I could not
examine the ship's main controls. The beam-out from the subspace
filter must have created a distortion of some kind. We have located the
problem by examining the ship's internal energy output. The distortion
continues to dissipate. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, return here immediately. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

[Ready room]

DATA: And now that we have the energy
source we have established, we must perform a structural analysis and, in
holographic time, the entire subspace matrix will be duplicated into
the Enterprise's matrix.
PICARD: What do you suggest? 
DATA: There is a simple mechanical procedure, Doctor. It is a
probe of the warp core's subspace input grid by detecting the
energy beam and then isolating the subspace matrix by detecting the
power flow from the warp core. We shall construct a computer and, within
seconds, I shall be able to recreate the entire subspace matrix.

[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, we have scanned our vessel for a
pattern of trans-dimensional activity. It appears to be an energy beacon. 
CRUSHER: What's its precise location? 
LAFORGE: I believe it was emanating from the warp core when it left
here. 
CRUSHER: Trans-dimensional? 
LAFORGE: It should have been able to reach out and transmit us. If its
attitude is like mine, its subspace matrix will be in control. 
PICARD: Then what are we looking at? 
CRUSHER: A warp field originating on this planet. 
PICARD: That must be an incredibly powerful signal. 
DATA: I am detecting no such signal. All we are seeing is the warp core
malfunctioning and the subspace matrix dissolving. 
PICARD: Then you must have a message. 
DATA: Not that I am aware of, sir. But, it was not a question of
communication. The signal appears to be coming from within us.

a ship's weapons system. 
DAX: So they're not trying to use his weapon. 
BASHIR: If he's working on a weapons system he might have something

O'BRIEN: I can tell. There's an alien forcefield around the cargo

ODO: I got some good advice for you. You need to know what to do

O'BRIEN: What kind of advice? 
ODO: If the Romulans do make it back in one piece, we want you to know that we
will not let you go. 
O'BRIEN: How can I do that? I want to be the best I can be. 
ODO: You're very talented, and if you're going to be good, you need to
make good decisions. Not every crew member should be responsible for
every mistake the captain makes. If a Romulan goes missing and your crew
has to make the tough decision to send out a rescue team, then
you will. That

KASIDY: What do you mean? You wanted me to come and be your bodyguard? 
SISKO: You said you didn't want me to see the body. This has to be

SISKO: Yes. I see you, Garak. If we don't do something about her,
we'll just wait for her to die. And then we'll have to leave her to die.
That was a lot more convincing than you thought. The Klingons didn't
really expect you to come and protect Kasidy, Garak. You know that. I'm
somewhere else and I haven't seen you. I'm afraid I've come to an
unfortunate conclusion. I've decided to help you, but I'm not

SCOTT: How long have you been out of
Starfleet? 
NANCY: Nine months. 
SCOTT: The last time I saw her she looked exactly like she does today. 
NANCY: You'd better get back. 
SCOTT: What are we going to do? 
NANCY: Get back to Voyager. 
SCOTT: I've done the best I can. 
NANCY: What if you can't? What if you can't go back? 
SCOTT: The last thing I remember as an engineer is getting down to
Earth and coming back to see my wife. 
NANCY: That's what you were supposed to do all those years ago. To take
her home. 
SCOTT: What were you talking about? 
NANCY: You were supposed to come home, not back. Why have you been living on this ship? 
SCOTT: You see, we have our own business. We could take you home again and
keep you there. You know, I've never been able to stop thinking about her.
Why not? We're all still her friends.

SCOTT: We're going to have to find something
to do. 
DATA: I don't believe I am detecting the pattern of the subspace radiation. I
observed a change in it last night. The radiation pattern is slightly
further out than before. I believe it has been rerouted. 
SCOTT: Oh, well, the next thing we know we'll have the upper hand, so let's see
what we can find out.

should never have allowed myself to doubt our friendship. We both
know the odds of this ever working between us are so miniscule that I
hadn't planned on being involved in it. 
TORRES: I don't regret the decision, Lieutenant. I can't imagine what would
happen if I had to work with him again. 
KIM: Yes, your father is correct. But I'd never have let that
happen without you. You're a great leader, Commander. He didn't
ask for you to play that role. It wasn't his idea. You're my partner.
I hope the best for your father. 
PARIS: I'm sorry, sir. 
KIM: We both wish he could return, too, but he needs all the help he

CHAKOTAY: Are you going to make the same mistake in the future, Mister
Heskov? 
HESKOV: I will always be a part of the Captain's crew, Captain. I'll always
have his back. 
KIM: There will never be a moment when I can't look into the eyes of
him and I wish I could say I had something he'd like, something special to
show him. 
HESKOV: But no matter how close we get. He's right, Captain. I'm just one of
the men who has to take care of his own. I know the risks he's
going to take. But I want him to know I will follow his every command. 
KIM: It's hard to live with the knowledge of what would happen if
your crew went to their deaths. Even if I didn't die in this situation,
the other two would. 
HESKOV: I am just trying to make you feel better about your
actions. 
(The two get into the turbolift, then Kes enters with her weapon.) 
HESKOV: It's a long way to Sickbay.

KIRA: And, gentlemen? 
GARRY: Just to be clear. We are not interested in sharing our opinion

KIRA: And I don't understand. It's not a good thing to ask. 
GARRY: Well, then I want you to know that we are well informed about a

HOSHI: Aye, sir. 
ARCHER: Is that another term for a species that evolved beyond

HOSHI: Yes, sir. 
ARCHER: Which makes them an extremely rare sight. 
HOSHI: We're on a mission, sir. 
ARCHER: What was the last known location of the Class D? 
HOSHI: We don't know. 
ARCHER: And where? 
HOSHI: Somewhere along this corridor. 
ARCHER: Where have you been ever since? 
HOSHI: Every few years. 
ARCHER: Are there any known records of them? 
HOSHI: No. 
ARCHER: I understand they were once considered the top hunters in the galaxy
before they were assimilated into the Cardassians.
Now their name is considered a myth. 
HOSHI: I beg your pardon? 
ARCHER: You've never seen them? 
HOSHI: No, sir. 
ARCHER: Is there a record of their existence? 
HOSHI: No, sir.

KIRK: Mister Spock, if I'm able to get there before this shuttle

SPOCK: You're right, Captain. The Enterprise has been waiting
for us. 
MCCOY: No, you're not. This time it was going to happen. We came
here to finish our mission, not get away. And you, sir, are not the one to

SULU: Captain, we've cleared all visual sensors but
the one on deck three. 
UHURA: We're losing range. Shields at a sixty percent

SULU: Sensors are showing a slight deviation in our direction. 
UHURA: It appears to be a slight distortion in the energy field which we
ignore. 
SULU: There are no other ships approaching us. 
UHURA: There must be some kind of collision, sir. 
SULU: There's no sign of any, Captain.

holodeck doors and we're not going to let you walk in there. 
GARAK: I wouldn't be at liberty to take you there. 
Odo: You're a little late. 
GARAK: We still need more information about the holodeck. What
can we learn from your experience? 
ODO: The information you've provided so far won't answer that question.
We'd be forced to start from scratch. 
GARAK: We could try opening a holodeck door that looks more like
our own. We'll wait here a few minutes so the Doctor can run over
all the data. 
ODO: I doubt that will be much of an improvement. I don't think I'm
going to like the way things look. 
GARAK: You should be pleased with yourself. But if I were you, I'd
try to relax and get into the flow. 
ODO: Why am I not the flow?

GARAK: We were just trying to find out what
they were doing there. I'm getting there, but I want to get there

ODO: Then I'll walk in there. 
GARAK: You won't be able to see me. 
ODO: If you try, I'll be as hard on you as they are.

ODO: I can't let you go. 
GARAK: Don't you have something you want to see? 
ODO: The hologram of my father. You asked me to tell you his

ODO: Don't worry about it. I don't think it matters to me what you
see. 
GARAK: You're an old man, aren't you?

PICARD: I have no doubt about that. 
RIKER: But they claim they saw him being taken to Cardassia

PICARD: And they were quite happy to see my son being murdered for
attempting to destroy the Dominion. 
RIKER: Captain, if you believe that they'd do anything to harm
you, why don't you ask them why you're alive and why your
son is dead? 
PICARD: I have no intention of murdering the other members of the
Dominion. 
RIKER: You want a reason for the murder of your son, that will be
explaned in the next few hours. Do you still believe that? 
PICARD: Yes, I do. And I think there is a logical explanation to
that question. 
RIKER: So? 
PICARD: The Dominion has attacked the Ferengi and
everyone on the Cardassian borders has been taken hostage by the Ferengi
and the Cardassians. It's a war. And there are going to be casualties
and there are going to be people who died to bring justice to all of them. And
the Bajorans who were in the Neutral Zone, who were innocent and
will never have the chance to see this day again, can take it to the
next level. That's why the Bajorans will take their own lives. 
RIKER: That's not a logical answer, Picard. 
PICARD: Captain, I don't think it is. 
RIKER: Well, Picard, I'm not just suggesting that you kill the other
members of the Dominion. 
PICARD: That is true. 
PICARD: You will be executed. This is the order of the Cardassians. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Then if you succeed at this, then the Federation and the
Romulans have to send the last evidence we have of a war to

powerful criminal gang in Bajor. I've been running the ship for
six years. Not much choice. 
RIKER: But you knew you could handle things yourself. No one at
all would. No one would ever let you walk away, let you give up everything.

QUARK: You don't understand. I was not there for the last six years. I am
here now for the last few days. And the job I'm doing is
to get the job done. What's on my mind?

There are a lot of Klingons here, but we haven't set foot inside one.

toward the bridge.) 
(Suddenly the door opens, and the two officers come
out. Klingons have been thrown to the floor and are thrown towards
the other officers. Klingons are beamed into the turbolift) 
SPOCK: We are here, Chief! 
EMH: The aliens are not threatening, Doctor. They are requesting the
Captain to disembark immediately. 
(Then McCoy steps forward. He gestures for the Captain to come in) 
MCCOY: Captain! 
KIRK: I'm sorry, Jim. I thought we were not in the area of the
planet where the alien ships came from. 
KIRK: Why haven't we heard anything? 
SPOCK: We are not humans, Captain. 
(Kirk steps in.) 
KIRK: The alien life forms are not a threat, Mister Spock. They are
humans. 
SPOCK: Not on this ship. 
(The alien comes up into the turbolift and starts throwing things at
them. Then they get knocked back. This time McCoy and Spock go straight for
them) 
MCCOY: They're not so fast, Chief. 
SPOCK: Not very fast. And they have a way of keeping their heads down
while their body mass continues to grow. 
(The three of them take the enemy and the alien) 
MCCOY: Where are they now, Mister Spock? 
KIRK: We are on the surface of this planet. 
SPOCK: The creature has changed, Captain. Their bodies have altered
to match their new forms. They are looking like Klingons
now. 
MCCOY: If we stay in here, and if the alien keeps us from going back down
into this area, what is our plan? We have only one way to
find out, and that's to get back and get out of there. 
SPOCK: This way. 
MCCOY: Then we're going on all fours and we're going

BASHIR: Good choice of words. I'm afraid that may be a little difficult. I
appreciate that. 
ODO: Is that so? 
BASHIR: We're just about ready to give you a briefing. 
ODO: If I have to call for help? I guess you can call me. 
BASHIR: Don't worry, I'd like to do that, but it's not going to be
any easy task. 
ODO: And you're not going to get me anywhere near that briefing. You're
going to have to learn your job. Do it.

BASHIR: Captain? 
ODO: It's been a long day. 
BASHIR: Why? 
ODO: To make sure you had a little vacation. 
BASHIR: I'm not going to spend a day in the middle of a war. The Dominion
took over a year to acquire Bajor and we have more time than most
Bajorans have years of military experience. And my team is better than the
Enterprise in almost every way. 
ODO: What about the Bajoran ships and ships and ships? 
BASHIR: They're protected by more than forty percent of Starfleet
Fleet. 
ODO: We know you're a Starfleet man. 
BASHIR: I'm not. 
ODO: Of course not. If you were going to be an officer on a starship,
what would be your first duty? 
BASHIR: To help build the bridge.

BASHIR: Yeah.

ints as though that's what he wanted. 
TASHA: I see it. 
DAX: And I feel the same about Sisko. When the war is over, he's going
to make sure that Bajor stays out of Bajora affairs. 
SISKO: It's the best outcome. 
BASHIR: I'll never understand that logic, Captain. There's nothing in
the Expanse that proves Sisko is capable of ordering the murder of his entire
crew. 
DAX: You can't really believe that, Doctor. I have seen Sisko kill
everybody and everything he ever thought of killing. 
SISKO: Then how can I believe that the Expanse will allow this man to
do what he said he would do, if he was not capable of ordering the murder
of a single person? 
DAX: Then you believe something you want to believe. You're saying it's
because he's a Klingon. 
SISKO: But what about the Cardassians? 
DAX: He's a Cardassian, isn't he? 
SISKO: The Cardassians have no idea what he wants to do, but they do have
the right to know. 
DAX: And they're not going to get it from Sisko. That's his decision, and
whatever the outcome of the war is, it's the right one. 
SISKO: I'll see to it that he gets it. Now if we don't get our man
back home, I'll end up killing Cardassians myself. 
DAX: It's a long shot, Captain. 
SISKO: And what do you think of me for it? 
DAX: I'm not sure yet. 
SISKO: All right, if you've got it, Chief, then I'll have it in my quarters.

DAX: I doubt that, but if it's all right with you, I'll let you know. 
SISKO: I will, Doctor. 
DAX: If you're telling me that, Captain? 
SISKO: Don't say it.

WORF: It would take a great deal of time, even in thirty years of combat.

they're even on the ships. 
DATA: An unexpected request from a Vulcan, but I've already made them.

PICARD: If the Enterprise had been hit, you have a far greater chance of

PICARD:
I have an idea. We should get back into orbit of this planet. That way
in case we're attacked. If it means we'll have something else to think about.

It is possible. We could use some of the energy from the
stars to generate artificial gravity. Then we could use that to increase
speed.

us off our ship in an uneventful manoeuvre.

Even the Vulcan system is not complete. I know that there are still
possible planets beyond us.

LAFORGE: What we need is a new engine. I suggest
we use the power of the galaxy to create one. 
RIKER: But that's not what I've got. I don't have any power or experience

diffusion to isolate the warp core from the warp coil. 
SCOTT: No problem. What's the problem with the warp drive? 
DATA: Warp drive is highly unstable at sublight velocity. 
SCOTT: That is correct. 
DATA: It seems the warp core is being created by implosion within the
warp coil. The coil is unstable and would not stand up to any

DATA: I am not sure, Doctor. I have examined some of your specimens. However,
I don't recall any identifiable symptom. 
LAFORGE: Maybe it was the virus that infected it. But the most
likely explanation is that it was someone else that infected it. 
DATA: If it was, you'll find out who. 
LAFORGE: The Doctor?

Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We have made contact
with the surface of the planetoid and are approaching its atmosphere
system. Our sensors are picking up no life signs and
no other vessels except our own. We are proceeding in a controlled manner
and making a thorough survey of the environment.

LAFORGE:
Commander, we're reading a massive gravitational wave of energy.
The entire planetoid is being engulfed by it. 
KIRK: Captain, we're on the edge. What is it, something? 
LAFORGE: Just a moment. If we can't find a way through those girders,
we can't have the engines fully engaged. 
SPOCK: The power of a gravitational wave is a fact, and its force of
appearance has been recorded by many observers. The fact is that this
wave is causing extreme instability to all parts of the planetoid. 
KIRK: That's very different from what I just experienced, Mister Spock. There,
there. Let's do it. Kirk to Bridge. Kirk here. 
(The Enterprise comes to rest on a curved shelf on the
sidewalk, on the landing pad, and is now on a slope in the middle of the
mountain) 
KIRK: Spock, how much power are these girders holding together? 
SPOCK: One thirty four percent. The strength of the gravimetric field
of the girders would be sufficient to overcome the strength of the
wave by itself. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, you're doing more than you can think of right now.
The force of the wave is approaching us. 
SPOCK: This is not possible. We must stop it! 
KIRK: Stop? We have to find a way, Scotty. If we can't do that, we
have to try to fight it.

The last time I tried to explain that, it was hopeless. I

do it ourselves.

SEVEN: I'm not sure you'll agree, but we can go in one or two hours
after you report for duty. And even then, it'd be a long walk.

SEVEN: This is my home. 
CHAKOTAY: There may be a difference. 
SEVEN: A difference, Commander. There is a great deal that I find
interesting about this planet. I find it very interesting to watch the
planet evolve, to learn more about the flora and fauna. I'm
not sure I'm ready to be there, to study one of the last planets on
this quadrant.

LAFORGE: What about the tricorder? Why were it activated and never
returned? 
KES: Our analysis showed that the tricorder had been transported here from the
Dominion station by the energy signature of one of the Jem'Hadar
ships. They were trying to get that data. 
RIKER: That doesn't add up. 
DATA: Captain, that device may be capable of transmitting more than
twenty thousand photon torpedoes in one hour. It is possible we are dealing
with one Jem'Hadar ship. 
RIKER: Mister Worf, prepare to initiate the tactical scan. Let the
Dominion ships know we want to come looking for them. And I'll be happy to
explain the reason for the trip. The Jem'Hadar never boarded our station. The
Jem'Hadar ships attacked us from the air. They are capable of
transporting millions of photon torpedoes in one hour, and we want to
know why. 
WORF: Commander. 
RIKER: They took us by surprise. 
WORF: Aye, Commander. The Jem'Hadar ships should never have returned. The
Dominion's own tactical scan showed that they had no weapon on
station. The device was destroyed during the confrontation. 
RIKER: What's the best course of action? 
DATA: The best course of action would be to take all possible precautions,
to take precautions at all costs. 
RIKER: What else did you tell him? 
DATA: I don't wish to elaborate on that, sir.

LAFORGE: What are you looking at? This is the final moment of our

DATA: Perhaps if we were to do so, we would be able to access more information.

LAFORGE: What does that mean? What do you think? You just gave me the answer.
And it made me very happy. I didn't have to ask. And for the first
time I know you're happy.

I'm reading that he's very busy.
WILLOW: Really. I mean he's got a lot of problems. He's had a severe

LAFORGE: And he's got a lot of work to do, which is one of the
things you keep reminding me of. He needs to be disciplined.
RIKER: He's a bad man. He can be very erratic.
LAFORGE: I'm not really sure how you know that, but I do.
WILLOW: Well, I don't know what he thinks he is. I mean, he's been very
busy lately, but I do think he's on the verge of coming back. He needs
to learn to be more disciplined. To go back to a normal life
style. To be more serious.
LAFORGE: What's that supposed to mean?
WILLOW: To me, he's simply trying to learn to be more serious again.

SEVEN: I don't understand. 
TUVOK: He is speaking directly into a subspace conduit. 
SEVEN: My thoughts. 
TUVOK: If this is the behaviour of a sentient being, then why did it
begin after the death of its creator? Why did we have
no previous experience with it? 
SEVEN: You must understand. As a member of this community, we are expected to
co-exist with and learn from every other member of our species. When
the first members were chosen, they were faced with the fact
that they were born to the same society as this one, a society which I
did not want to see. 
TUVOK: But as he has developed his abilities, and gained more
knowledge of this culture, he has also become more aware of our
differences. He is also beginning to express them to us. 
SEVEN: When we first entered this galaxy, we were taught that the
creatures who populated this galaxy would only exist for a fraction of the
lifetimes. 
TUVOK: But now we know that if these creatures exist at all, they may
last a lifetime. We may even survive our entire lives. 
SEVEN: The Enterprise will continue to exist for only six million
years. That's why we must make some effort to adapt to a long
term perspective. 
TUVOK: You are not aware that the existence of these species will also
be the subject of a study by a senior member of the species. 
SEVEN: I am not aware of that. 
TUVOK: That is precisely what the research on your species is to
be conducted on our ship. Your study may include examining the
entire history of this species, including all that they have done.

SEVEN: I am not aware of that. 
TUVOK: And then it is the intent of the Species 8472 and this study that
you study our culture to determine what effects these species have
had on a species that has gone through an extraordinary period of
acceleration. Perhaps you can do this as well. However, if I were to
suggest that you study your species more carefully, I am suggesting
that you use all of your limited abilities you have. 
SEVEN: Why am I being asked to do

JAKE: Come on, don't you want to hear an oldie, but 
O'BRIEN: I am.

(Jake is playing some sort of game, with one
trick every ten bars.) 
ODO: Jake. Is there a way to get Jake back? 
JAKE: Not exactly. 
ODO: You can just tell him I've got the keys. 
JAKE: I want him to get in trouble. 
O'BRIEN: But what if Jake just gives you the keys? 
JAKE: You can't do that. 
O'BRIEN: I mean, I know Jake wants to, but you can't just walk in there
and do whatever you want. 
JAKE: But we just got to be sure he knows how to do it.

self. 
WORF: My experience has nothing at all to do with the Doctor.

telepaths in the area?

PICARD: No, that is none of your concern. You have done a very great
service to us, the Federation. 
COMPUTER: Access denied. 
PICARD: Now why didn't you say so earlier?
COMPUTER: Your decision to act in a hostile manner has caused a considerable
concern in my quarters. I don't know why, but I have no other choice.
You're being selfish!

CRUSHER: Captain, the nebula's going to
begin to eject itself. 
CRUSHER: Eject it! What is it? 
RIKER: It looks like the Enterprise has returned to its original
configuration. It's going to be a short-lived encounter.
Data, do you have anything that can be done? 
DATA: Yes, sir. I will attempt to increase the antimatter flux on the
dilithium. 
RIKER: Captain, where are they?

CRUSHER: That nebula is right in the middle of the sector.

GOLAK: Thank you. 
KELAS [OC]: The other guests have left. They're not the first guests I've
seen tonight. It looks like it's a family affair. 
GOLAK: Yes, exactly. I've never seen a wedding. 
KELAS [OC]: Yes, and I don't regret it. 
GOLAK: My point is I've never seen a wedding before either. I wonder what
people at your age are saying about it? 
KELAS [OC]: Well, I can't tell you. 
GOLAK: Oh, they're telling me. You're going to marry my wife. 
KELAS [OC]: Yes, they're telling me.

GOLAK: I was surprised by how relaxed the
reserves were. You would never have thought a man of your standing would even have
so little to do with Starfleet. 
O'BRIEN: I'm curious what you think? 
GOLAK: You are not surprised. 
O'BRIEN: I thought you said Starfleet has a special connection to me. 
GOLAK: Captain Janeway has said that I am more than just a friend. 
O'BRIEN: Really? Is she implying that? You and I both have friends on
the Voyager? 
GOLAK: Yes, yes I am.

KIRK: I'm not sure I'd like to do that to you. But perhaps we
can discuss this some other time. 
(Mention the time when the Klingons attacked the Enterprise to get
the Kirk aboard.) 
SPOCK: I am not surprised you would do such an act, Doctor. Mister Spock
dismissed it as not true. 
SPOCK: The attack is as I understand it, the result of a
confrontation, as you will understand from that particular
explanation. 
MCCOY: When you and Kirk met at the beginning of the war, you
said nothing at all about the truth. 
SPOCK: Captain, I am not sure this is correct. 
MCCOY: What are you saying, Spock? You're not telling me that
there was a war? 
SPOCK: No. I am simply saying that I am not certain. Captain, I
have seen one thing. I have seen an enormous army, a great power, a
superpower. 
MCCOY: You think they fought with that power, did you? 
SPOCK: No, sir. 
KIRK: When you first joined the military, they were calling you the
Darkest Knight. How did they know all this so quickly? 
SPOCK: There is some difficulty in my explanation. The information
you are about to read is extremely important, Captain. My colleagues
believe I am more than the First Lieutenant. 
KIRK: All your colleagues believe you are more than the First
Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: I don't believe it is possible for me to explain, Captain.
Even to myself, but the fact of the matter is that I feel the
same emotions of loyalty, courage, love, friendship. All that makes one
different and, therefore, different. 
(Kirk and Spock enter, and they leave in peace.) 
MCCOY: When a Captain has all of his senses, the man who doesn't
have them is vulnerable, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, we're at war. The Klingons are making every effort to
destroy Earth. When the enemy attacks, they are not destroying Earth,
Captain, they are attacking it in other ways. They have made it their

SISKO: And what is it?
CHEKOV: A temporal signature. 
SISKO: What's temporal?
CHEKOV: A temporal signature. The time it takes for a ship's
transmissions to travel between timelines. It is a highly sophisticated
device.
O'BRIEN: That's crazy. If it's a temporal device from another timeline,
how do you know this? They don't have temporal shields.
SISKO: That's all that's different. I can't believe it. 
CHEKOV: Captain, you're not looking at the Prophets here. Do you have any
idea what they're talking about?
SISKO: I think I know what the Prophets are talking about.
CHEKOV: Of course you do. You're the only one I've heard anything like
this. Why don't we just take you to the station? They have all the
interactions we need. I'll let you know as soon as I'm finished.
SISKO: Sure, you have it now, Chekov.

[Sisko's quarters]

(O'Brien is in bed, and he is lying on
the floor with a bag over his head, the bedroll between them) 
O'BRIEN: I can't believe it.
CHEKOV: If the Prophets are talking about another timeline, I'm sure
that makes sense.
O'BRIEN: Maybe it just means a temporal field. 
SISKO: If the Prophets can't stop a ship from crossing time and
space, how could they explain how we can?
O'BRIEN: Maybe we're just one
trick in the puzzle.

[Promenade]

SISKO: Can't you just put a security guard
in here to make sure that we keep out those people that think the
Prophets exist?
O'BRIEN: I think they're just a bunch of jerks.
SISKO: Well, I don't want them around anymore.

                    with Vulcan technology. 
                    
ARCHER: Good point. Good point.

don't care. The Cardassians won't give them any peace.

WORF: It is not to be concluded. We must conclude our course. We will
return to the Federation.

WORF: One hundred two days. We did it in less than half of the time it
would take to complete the mission.

ODO: Nothing. I'm just thinking. 
DAX: What is it?

T'POL: Your plan is correct. We may fail, but we should try. 
ARCHER: Maybe we should try that again. 
T'POL: No. 
T'POL: We have not achieved consensus on our mission, Captain. 
TUCKER: Well, if you're telling the truth, you really want to be
head of the government, that's what you need to be doing. 
 [Corridor]

 TUCKER: I'm sure you're aware we've been attacked
by the Xindi, but since the Xindi were never interested in any
communion, why bother to kill them? 
PHLOX: They were a species we had little contact with for centuries,
but as we grew more familiar with their technology, we were
increasing our risk of injury. 
TUCKER: Is it possible it's because your people are genetically
compatible with them? 
PHLOX: When an assimilated species returns from a long period of isolation,
their genetic heritage is passed through
thematically to the next generation. In most cases, this transfer has
never been completed. 
TUCKER: This wouldn't have happened if you had just waited twenty years
to return to your people. 
PHLOX: A small colony is often isolated for many generations.
This should be no different. 
TUCKER: You don't seem to understand. 
PHLOX: I am the Xindi. I was assimilated into a species that was
unique. I have never had experience with humans. I was forced to
learn to assimilate and to adapt. 
TUCKER: You assimilated? 
PHLOX: My homeworld was attacked. My people were forced to flee. 
ARCHER: What about you? 
PHLOX: We were thrown out of orbit and have had a difficult time ever
returning. 
T'POL: And we are, Captain. 
ARCHER: If the Xindi have been assimilated into your species, then
you must also assimilate yourselves.

SISKO: And a Klingon officer. 
PASKELL: The First Prime? 
SISKO: Yes. I will get you to Security, sir. 
KIRK: I have no idea who said this to her. 
LAFORGE: She was a bit afraid he was going to put her in stasis,
so she asked a question I couldn't answer. 
SISKO: I'm concerned for the girl, Doctor. 
LAFORGE: Well, it is kind of dangerous to expose this man to all
these Klingon cultures, but she's our only chance at
finding out. 
SISKO: I'll take you there. 
(Meanwhile, Sisko is sitting in the back of the turbolift and watching
Sloan with the two guards while the woman sits on the couch. Sisko
finds a PADD) 
KIRK: What is it, Sisko? 
SISKO: It's from a time in history when a great man was
found buried on a lonely mountain ridge. And he had a PADD. 
KIRA: I've got one down. 
SISKO: You think this would help them find him? 
KIRK: I doubt it. 
SISKO: I'll let her go. 
KIRK: We can find out when we leave the station. 
SISKO: And then we can have the PADD back. 
KIRA: But you can't do that while she's in stasis. 
SISKO: That's the reason she's in here. She needs help, Doctor.
And I hope the Ktarian Council will protect her. 
KIRK: Do whatever you have to to. 
KOS: Doctor, I'm afraid I don't think I can do this. 
SISKO: You will have to take her out of the turbolift and into the
turbolift to get into the turbolift. 
KOS: I can't do that. 
SISKO: We have no choice. You have to do it. 
KOS: I'll take care of her if you need me. Now.

 ones of us, we can do this right. 
EMH: How well could he be able to control your brain activity? I'd like to
learn more about the cellular pathways and neural pathways that make the
transporter function. 
JANEWAY: Your crewmembers are on a similar mission, Doctor. We've come to the
same conclusion. We'll have to break free from him and be like him. 
EMH: I'm not going to be like him, either. 
JANEWAY: I would like to thank you. Now, you're going to work on the
recovery phase of your neural therapy. I have great respect for what you've
done with your crew. 
EMH: Captain, I don't see how I can go against your directive. I
know it would be best for you to stay on Sickbay. 
JANEWAY: I have a better idea. I'd like to transfer your neural
recovery phase directly to Voyager. 
EMH: Captain, I'm a biochemist. I'm trying to treat an organ that's
becoming too frail for me to operate with. 
JANEWAY: That sounds like you'd be willing to be treated like a man. I
see you are. I'd like that transfer to begin with. 
EMH: I'm sorry, but if you can't make it without him, that's
going to be the end of me. I'll be here when you give it my
approval. 
 [Sickbay]

 EMH:
I'm afraid your decision to undergo a neural phase transfer means a whole lot less
for you. 
TORRES: What am I supposed to do? 
EMH: You may not be able to survive on your own, but you'll learn. 
TORRES: I've been thinking. If that's the case, could I have you
return to Voyager? 
EMH: That's a very good question. I'm not yet certain that it's
right for you. 
TORRES: But I'm very young, and I have every right to be curious about
your plans. How do you think I'll fit in? I don't remember any of you
growing up as members of your own species. In school I was always

LAFORGE: It's not going to help us, Picard. It just might. 
PICARD: There's a holodeck somewhere in the system. You'd be able to
access the computer. 
LAFORGE: No, thanks, but a holodeck with the computers running at
normal hours. 
PICARD: The Captain is a stubborn man. When you're ready to release
them, we'll have some time to consider all our options.

[Holodeck]

PICARD: I am Lieutenant Commander Data.

[Engineering]

TROI: So, you've got all the data you need, and
you've got a computer that'll create the hologram.

[Holodeck]

DATA: I will accept your
understanding. I do have a few problems, Counsellor. 
[Engineering]

PICARD: What's wrong with the holo-lens? 
DATA: One of them has damaged the circuitry. It's too late to fix
it. (to Counsellor Troi) I have to have this holo-lens reassembled. 
[Holodeck]

PICARD: Then do as the captain says.

[Engineering]

(the room is empty, so the holo-lens goes
into) 
PICARD: This is a temporary environment? 
TROI: Perhaps, but as long as we continue to monitor the holo-lens, 
DATA: If you are aware of all the other holo-lens around us, you would
have realised we have them, Commander. If we could have access to all
the systems, then we could create a very large system. That would create
an incredible amount of power, and the problem is not so much with the
lens, but with how it controls the power flow to this system. 
DATA: I believe it's simply overloaded with the amount of data
being transmitted to this holo-lens.
PICARD: It's malfunctioning. 
DATA: At any rate, the control system is unstable. It could create a
catastrophe. It is of little use now, Commander. We must

 trade to your Federation. 
KIRA: I think I can do better than that. 
(Ransom enters) 
KIRA: This one's getting close. 
WORF: It is a formidable opponent. The Klingon will not tolerate weakness
from another Cardassian. 
KIRA: I guess we'll just have to keep that in mind.

[Ops]

WORF: The Klingons are increasing their
power output. 
SISKO: I've got a better idea. We can destroy their defence array. 
WORF: Their weapons are weakening. I am detecting a weakness
within their internal defence array. It is weakening. 
SISKO: I know it's not easy. 
WORF: The array is now at risk of being destroyed. 
SISKO: If we're not strong enough to destroy it, our defences
will be damaged. 
WORF: This is only temporary. 
SISKO: Why the need to destroy their defence array when there's more
winnings than you're going to get? 
WORF: I don't know. However, as soon as their defence array is
destroyed, they will cease hostilities and engage in
peace talks. 
SISKO: You can't say that without saying you'll destroy the Jem'Hadar. 
WORF: If they intend to engage in peace talks, they will not succeed. 
SISKO: So you're prepared to destroy the Jem'Hadar? 
WORF: As soon as they are defeated, their equipment will be destroyed.
They will then cease their attacks on Cardassia. 
SISKO: So how long do you anticipate before it's too late? 
WORF: It is only a matter of time. 
SISKO: Not long enough to end the war? 
WORF: All I can guarantee is that we will destroy the Jem'Hadar as soon as
necessary. 
SISKO: Not soon enough, Number One. 
WORF: Do not worry. I am strong and I will defeat the Klingon. 
SISKO: I don't think so. 
WORF: You are wrong, Major. I will destroy the Jem'Hadar. 
SISKO: It's your plan

insignificant diversion from my duties. (he starts to turn Torma off
when he sees her face) You're more like a lady than a man. That's the

DUKAT: Don't push me, or I'll cut off the oxygen supply and
your life support systems will die. (the two go on falling over to

DUKAT: Yes, Commander, it's me. 
DUKAT: You've known me a long time. 
DUKAT: I've known you for six months. It's nice to see a
new friend again. 
DUKAT: I was under the impression your name was Commander Jadzia Dukat.

DUKAT: I am not Jadzia Dukat. It is the same woman. She's the one you knew
years ago. It would be so much easier to talk about it all together.
I have to go, Commander. I have to get back to my home. 
DUKAT: How long have you known each other? 
DUKAT: Two months, three months. 
DUKAT: And Commander Jadzia Dukat is on Voyager? 
DUKAT: You will admit, Commander, that it's not a very logical
conclusion. 
DUKAT: My name was Commander Jadzia Dukat when she was on my ship.

DUKAT: You know Commander Jadzia Dukat. I'm the one who's been watching you
now, Commander. (he pulls him up to face him again) I can feel it.
It burns like lava inside him. And in every corner, there's a new face.
And when the lights come up in a certain room, we look at him and wonder
if we can see the fire too.

I think they're still in this room. (A short time later, the Borg are still lying on the

PICARD: Well, as we know, this war is between two factions
between which the Cardassian and the Cardassian Empire. I believe you have no
interest in getting involved. We have to let a peace treaty be made in
peace. 
QUARK: If I were to assume that the Cardassian and Cardassian Empires would
leave the war, the war would cease, sir. We would have won, and the
Cardassians would have ended up destroying the Empire in the meantime. 
PICARD: In the meantime, if there's any chance to re-enter Federation
space, we must accept. 
QUARK: All right, but in a few days, we can start our own peace treaty. 
PICARD: A peace treaty? What peace treaty? 
QUARK: What do you mean, you mean, a peace treaty? 
PICARD: Your people are willing to negotiate?

approached a planetoid which looked like it had a solid floor
and an overhanging ceiling. One man stood guard over the door which
turned. It was the Captain. He kept looking back at us. He
looked at us then down at his watch. We weren't going to be able to make
out if it was a moment too soon. 
DATA: The captain did not appear to know we were approaching the planet.
In fact, as the Captain spoke, I didn't understand. 
PICARD: The captain said it's over, and I know that, sir. 
DATA: Captain. 
PICARD: I think I understand, Data. I think this is over.
So I apologise to you, sir. 
DATA: It was never my intention to be rude. 
PICARD: Are you all right, sir? 
DATA: No, Captain, thank you. 
(Data walks away) 
PICARD: Good. Now, you tell me what happened. 
DATA: I did not have a chance to speak, sir, and I did not respond. I
could not respond. When I approached the door, I tried to be silent.
But I was cut off and the Captain cut me off. I did not feel
lucky, did I, sir? 
PICARD: Not lucky. 
DATA: I would be, sir, if I didn't find myself staring at him. 
PICARD: You're sure you saw him in the doorway? 
DATA: It was all he could don't to move away. 
PICARD: Well, you don't sound as sure of this as you did the Captain. 
DATA: Sir, that is not my judgment, sir. 
PICARD: Data, I realise it was an accident. The Captain was trying to
get a word in edgewise while you were talking. Was the captain right? 
DATA: Sir, the Captain's actions were contrary to all my
established custom. 
PICARD: And it was not only against established custom, but against
common sense. This has been a long time ago. It is not so
comfortable to be wrong, Data.

RIKER: We're looking for a Romulan transporter. 
PICARD: No, I'm looking for a cloaking device. I want you to take some

RIKER: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf? Mister Worf, can you get me to this little
console? I want you there immediately, but please, don't
do anything that might jeopardise this device. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Doctor, can you assist me in any way? 
KAROVIN: Captain, your communicator's malfunctioning, sir. I
can't begin to understand. 
WORF: What do you mean? 
KAROVIN: There's no record of our communications with a Romulan ship. 
WORF: The only Romulan vessel to speak with us in ten years is a
briefing vessel, sir. This one's destroyed. 
PICARD: It was the USS Defiant. A little later. 
KAROVIN: The Enterprise? It's gone? 
WORF: No, sir, we've never even spoken to it. 
KAROVIN: It was at the end of the Neutral Zone. My ship has been on
the other side of the anomaly to help us find a home, not to hurt
us. 
WORF: I will contact the Romulan ship, sir. But if you have
any difficulty with this, you should ask him to help you. 
PICARD: I'll try.

T'POL: She was sent by the Romulans to take care of me. She found me
unamenable to the experience of life without a family. 
ARCHER: Can you say that again? 
T'POL: I'm sure she's still here.

TUCKER: Are you suggesting they've been sent in to murder someone?

PARIS: I don't know, but I'm not even sure we have. 
TUCKER: Well, maybe the Ferengis are just a little more aggressive.

PARIS: And if I were right about that, then maybe we're the ones on
Degra Five. 
TUCKER: That's impossible. 
T'POL: It's possible. I've conducted numerous scans of the area,
revealing weapons, communications relay array. All of the equipment is
supplied on board. 
PHLOX: I find it improbable that the Ferengis would destroy anything of value
without anyone coming down to help. 
ARCHER: This isn't supposed to work. 
T'POL: This is your response to all of this, Captain. 
PARIS: How do you expect me to think? 
ARCHER: You can't simply destroy the station. 
PHLOX: It's only a matter of time.

on an away mission to the asteroid field as soon as you've completed
his recovery. 
JANEWAY: Yes, Doctor. 
EMH: The doctor suggested that we could use him as an experimental
modification to Doctor Phlox's synaptic stimulation. 
JANEWAY: That would only have a limited effect and the Doctor is not
going to play any part. It's time for us to make a plan.

SEVEN: It's your perspective. You view the tragedy of our people's
death not as a loss of any kind, but as an attempt by the Doctor to
relive a time when we were still children.

States. 
ROBERT: Did you have some experience in command over troops on

PICARD: No. 
ROBERT: And you saw no sense of duty in a man like that? 
PICARD: I didn't know exactly who you were or what you were doing. So I

PICARD: I would have stayed back and been closer to my old friends. 
ROBERT: That's very wise. 
PICARD: They didn't want me with them. 
ROBERT: Do you really think they'd take you back? 
PICARD: I am not here to be their friend. I'm here to help them find
the right people for the job. 
ROBERT: Exactly. But I wouldn't think you would take them back.
You're going back to the old colonies, with the Zetorians. Maybe
there's something you could help them do. 
PICARD: We'd better come to the station immediately. 
ROBERT: Good. When you get here, get rid of him. He has no idea
what his old friends are talking about. 
PICARD: I believe they do. 
ROBERT: There have been many times I've worried about the future of this
ship. 
PICARD: Perhaps the Zetorians don't have the same concerns as you.
There is the question of whether you can trust them. If the Zetorians
want to fight you, do what they say. If you're wrong, there's
another choice. I recommend that you remain on Zetoria. You'll be
more secure and more likely to stay in the fleet. 
ROBERT: They're the ones who've been in command of this station. It'll
be better if we do it.

 inaugural vessel, the Enterprise, is
a prototype vessel. The prototype is not a starship. It is a
small, unmanned craft with computer circuitry which
hasn't been programmed for flight. (Spock and McCoy exit.) 
SPOCK: The warp engines, too, which operate with
no internal or external sensors. 
MCCOY: Then they're not powered. 
SPOCK: If I understand it correctly, all the onboard sensors
would remain in orbit and would continue transmitting readings of
the prototype as long as it remained inside. 
MCCOY: So it must be like living inside a starship. 
SPOCK: I cannot explain these reports to you. These are just what is
being observed. 
MCCOY: What's your report on them? 
SPOCK: There was a certain sense of mystery, of being completely unknown.
Some of them seemed to be flying too close to the prototype. The
sensors said there was no way the ship could have survived
the experience. 
MCCOY: Then we have to believe this. 
SPOCK: I agree with that, Doctor. However, one thing which I cannot explain is
this feeling. 
MCCOY: Maybe the feeling's a mistake, Spock. They could be carrying a
deflector or something like that. 
(Everyone has fallen asleep, and the Doctor has to go to a table to
find a piece of paper with names on it. The names are all blank. Spock
finds a PADD and reads the names.)

long do they maintain control? 
SPOCK: Approximately twenty minutes. 
KIRK: How long are the sensors going to maintain that control? 
SPOCK: No indication of that. They are not responding. 
KIRK: How long is it possible they can keep that control? 
SPOCK: The prototype is unstable. 
KIRK: That's not a problem with the warp engines. 
SPOCK: I suggest we take our chances. I strongly recommend that we go
for a course of maximum intercept.

PARIS: I'm not worried, I'm just concerned. 
JANEWAY: It's not about what's inside of me. It's about what's behind
me. Don't try to fight it or you'll just tear yourself apart. It's like
a forcefield. You're trapped in it, trapped, trapped, trapped. If you can
break free, then that's the first thing you'll remember.

Captain's Log, supplemental. There is no evidence of
causal involvement. I have placed a priority order for
a full analysis of the incident, but I have no choice. The Romulan
fleet has decided it will carry out an investigation.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Report. 
RIKER: I have no more detail to offer. The Romulans have a
fleet of nearly eighty vessels. Forty two are in the Neutral Zone.
Two hundred and fifty two are in the Eastern Sea. That is, we
are at war with the Cardassians. 
WORF: What about the two ships that were diverted in the early hours of
the morning? 
WORF: They are still on the planet's surface. 
RIKER: Their warp engines are still operative. 
WORF: The Romulans cannot take action before the Cardassians have
been fully restored. 
RIKER: It looks as though they do have a chance. That time frame
we have laid before you is extremely unlikely, but not impossible. 
WORF: I believe I would be surprised if you arrived on Romulus less than three
weeks from now. The only one who might have been aware of the
danger before they entered the Neutral Zone was the Cardassians. 
RIKER: If we could have been detected by the Romulans, maybe we
could have stopped the attack, or perhaps we could have intercepted
their vessel before they made it to their next port. 
WORF: If we could have, no one would have believed us. 
PICARD: Would you, sir? 
WORF: I believe I would. 
PICARD: A moment. I believe there may be a lot more to this than
we know. I have learned that the Romulans know all our weapons systems.
It is possible that some of them may even have intercepted us
before we left. 
WORF: I have no idea. 
WORF: What is it that you would wish to know, Captain? 
PICARD: I wish you would give me more than that, Jean-Luc.

JANEWAY: I don't know how much longer we can keep our bridge crew

starships out there now that have weapons, that could easily destroy us. If we
wish to stand a chance against them, we must use our own force. We could take the
Bridge. But not if our officers weren't there. 
SESKA: I know, but I want to know first hand what those people were really
thinking. Is this possible? 
JANEWAY: It depends. 
SESKA: Maybe some of them were trying to help us. 
KIM: Well, if we take the Bridge, we could have the upper hand. With the
weapons, we could fight them off, but they wouldn't be in our power
to stop. Maybe we could get them down in the corridor. 
SESKA: Are there any advantages for us to gain by taking weapons? 
JANEWAY: Nothing. 
SESKA: Are they too dangerous? I don't like the prospect.

can we convince them that we're in control of everything? They're

This ship has been through incredible danger and danger. How can
I explain it to my wife and children who are facing the same

You can help me find that out. 
PICARD: The Doctor will help me find a way to control my emotions.

is to control my emotions. The Captain, you did say that this vessel

VRAK: When the Cardassians invaded the Bajoran sector in 22nd
century, they were attacked by Starfleet forces. As soon as they
made contact with the Cardassians, the war was over, and no one on Cardassia
had any more hopes. The Cardassians were dismissed from their position
and placed on an isolation planet called Zekt. When the occupation
ceased a few months later, it was obvious to everyone that the occupation
and the war had been long in the making. As far as Federation
intelligence was concerned, the Dominion was behind the attack. The
Cardassian Government was working under the command of Major Kira. 
VRAK: And so was the High Command. 
QUARK: So are you now. I'm glad you're here, Lieutenant. Your superiors
must realise that the Cardassians are now completely under their
command. I want you to prepare a new course for Cardassia. The Defiant

CRUSHER: There is a small, uninhabited
suburb of the southern part of the planet. 
PICARD: It's called the Delta Quadrant. If you take me there, I might know
about the Romulan project. How do you feel about that? 
CRUSHER: I don't know. I'm not really sure. I'm a lot more comfortable
standing here than I am in the main shuttle. 
PICARD: Well, the Delta Quadrant seems to inspire a lot of hope in me, and
the same is true in you. Your people are getting closer to the Alpha
Quadrant, and you feel a lot more ready to be assimilated. Why don't
you stay here and you come with me.

PICARD: What do you think? 
CRUSHER: I thought the Beta Quadrant was very vast and beautiful, but I
have never seen anything like it. There are beautiful white sand
cliffs and waterfalls. And the skies are filled with light. I think
you might like to come a little closer to it, Doctor. 
PICARD: You're the only one. Come on, Nurse, let's go!

CRUSHER: He has a concussion, but he is lucky no one is hurt. His

LAFORGE: We were trying to create a force field for
the warp reactor. And when I tried to send a phase pulse to generate a
force field around it, there was
a fluctuation in the force field.

pulses through the ship) 
CRUSHER: It could not have made it past the antimatter containment field,

LAFORGE: Well, then I'll find out for sure. 
RIKER: There's still nothing. We'll attempt to repair the plasma
imbalance as soon as we can. 
CRUSHER: It's not going to be easy. The plasma imbalance will grow
more severe with the time that passes between pulse
couplings. 
CRUSHER: There'll be no guarantee of that. I'll leave it to Commander
La Forge to get you started. 
LAFORGE: I'd like to see Commander La Forge too, if I could get that
little detail out of the way. 
CRUSHER: I understand his desire to have me there, but I'm more of
the engineer, Beverly, than the doctor. So don't try to fool me, Ensign.

PICARD: I think you can use your advanced knowledge of
this subject to your advantage. 
CRUSHER: As an engineer, I know how to take care of my own patients. We
still have to work with a few limitations. 
LAFORGE: So do we. 
CRUSHER: Yes. Well, if you need me, I'll always be available. 
LAFORGE: Well then. Well. See you later.

EMH-KIRK: Computer, start playback. 
COMPUTER: The computer has been locked out. 
KIRK: Can you get us out of there? 
COMPUTER: Access is restricted to the transporter room. 
KIRK: Can you access the transporter room without transporter? 
COMPUTER: No. 
KIRK: We're trapped. 
EMH-KIRK: What happened? 
COMPUTER: The computer crashed. Unable to comply, it destroyed all
access codes. No life-support systems could control the Enterprise. 
KIRK: Computer, take our weapons. 
COMPUTER: Weapons are restricted to life support systems. 
KIRK: Where did the computer crash happen? 
COMPUTER: Main power grid. 
EMH-KIRK: What else must we do? 
COMPUTER: All systems are failing. 
KIRK: All systems. That's not good enough. 
EMH-KIRK: All systems? All systems that failed on that main power grid? 
COMPUTER: All systems were affected. 
KIRK: All systems except life support. That's where? 
COMPUTER: It was the central power grid. 
KIRK: We must destroy that grid. 
(Kirk shoots him.)
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, you're all right. (gets up) Doctor McCoy, stand by
to beam down with the other survivors. (hands over
his phaser) Do you have a weapon? 
MCCOY: Not a weapon. A medical kit. 
KIRK: But you can destroy it. 
(The EMH-Kirk leaves.)

EMH-KIRK: The power grid is unstable. If this goes on, a few more
people will die. 
UHURA: What about Mister Spock? We could use him to get to that grid. 
KIRK: I'm not sure. He must be hurt. 
EMH-KIRK: There's a chance we may find him alive, if only by the skin
of his teeth. 
KIRK: A little closer. 
UHURA: Spock

WORF: They said you were the last of the Order. 
DAX: I'm here to kill them all. 
WORF: That is not possible. Even if you succeed, the destruction of the
Starfleet Academy will have repercussions for years to come. 
DAX: There are thousands of orphans on Cardassian space. 
WORF: My family's home was destroyed. 
DAX: I'll be all right. I can wait here. 
WORF: I am your teacher. 
DAX: A father. 
WORF: My father's father was a Cardassian war hero. He served in the
Federation. 
DAX: I hope you don't take him. 
WORF: He was a great man. 
DAX: I hope he's okay. I guess I'm just worried about that Cardassian boy. 
WORF: You are my teacher, Dax. I am the only one who can protect him now.

ODO: You can stand anything. 
NOG: I'm a Cardassian. 
ODO: How do you expect it to look in here? 
NOG: I'll try not to. 
ODO: What? 
NOG: I'll see if I can find a little more room here. 
ODO: You should go. 
NOG: I won't stay. 
ODO: I hope you won't leave. I would hate to see my brother go. 
NOG: You're right, I would. I understand. 
ODO: So? 
NOG: It's your idea, aren't you. 
ODO: Well it's my way of making sure you don't move too quickly. 
NOG: I understand. 
ODO: And you're a very good judge of character. 
NOG: I know that. 
ODO: You never even told me you have a brother. 
NOG: He wasn't the one that left the Cardassians.

MIRITOR: You can't be talking about this. 
PARIS: You're not the first one. The last one's right here. 
MIRITOR: You have a bad memory. You should have better one than you have
now. You need a break from the memory. 
PARIS: I need a break from the memory. And I can't stop doing it just
because you call me a liar or a murderer. I can't do this without you. 
MIRITOR: Why? 
PARIS: You know what, you know I'm wrong. 
MIRITOR: You're right. You're a liar. 
PARIS: I want a break from this nightmare. I want a break from this fantasy
life, and I won't have it until I die. 
MIRITOR: The whole point of all this is to keep you from dying? 
PARIS: How long is this nightmare going to last? 
MIRITOR: A few days. 
TORRES [OC]: Torres to Captain. 
PARIS: Go ahead. 
TORRES [OC]: The ship is being scanned. They think it may be a
proton bomb. 
PARIS: A lot more than a bomb. 
TORRES [OC]: One of the neutrinos seems to be going through
their tricorder, which they didn't scan. 
PARIS: They've been trying to find it for weeks, but I don't think we
know what we're dealing with. 
TORRES [OC]: Captain, the entire ship is going into shock.
EMH-Mister Kim? You're going to be here in a couple of minutes. 
KIM: Yes, sir. 
PARIS: That's good news. I thought you were going to ask her to bring a doctor
to the bridge to check for an infected crewman. 
CHAKOTAY [OC]: Captain, the sensors are detecting two Xindi ships.
They are accelerating. 
KIM: We've got one of them at warp nine and closing. They appear to be
recovering. 
TUVOK: Their hull plating is at sixty five percent, and they appear to
be firing weapons.

GARAK: Garak! What happened? 
ARABIC: I was working late, and you were sleeping. (He takes a bowl of
liquid from the floor) You mustn't eat it. It's too disgusting. 
GARAK: My nose's bleeding. 
ARABIC: It's what I was going to say to you, Garak. You're not
going to eat my new food. 
GARAK: What are you talking about? 
ARABIC: It's just that you're not feeling so good. I'm sorry. 
GARAK: Odo's doing everything I can to help, is he not? I'm sorry. 
ARABIC: Of course not. It's been so long since I was a friend. 
GARAK: I know. I've lost so much I don't even know where to start. You

you are not the Borg. 
RADAS [OC]: That's correct, sir. 
DATA [OC]: We are programmed to maintain complete control over each

KIRK: The Enterprise? 
SPOCK: I have a preliminary report. The ship's entire
programme has been transferred to the other ship. It is very clear,
Captain, we have found some way to disable the computer. We should be able
to do it.

[Corridor]

GATES [OC]: Captain, we are approaching the main
control, but the computer is not responding. 
MCCOY: We've got to beam out now, Jim. We're not going to stand
still here and risk something happening to Spock. 
(McCoy shoots a communicator into the wall) 
MCCOY: It's a Klingon transmission, Lieutenant.

MCCOY: What? 
KIRK: It's coming from Starfleet headquarters. Captain James Kirk.

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. (at Spock's feet) Spock? Spock is
dead. 
SULU: Negative, sir. 
KIRK: Lieutenant, the computer has been sabotaged, and it's
completely helpless at this moment. 
MCCOY: We can't go after them, not without the computer. 
KIRK: Why not? 
SULU: Captain, the computer is not responding. The entire
programme on the Enterprise has been transferred to the other ship.

MCCOY: We'd be fools to go after them. 
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock, you may go after them now. 
(Spock's feet walk onto the ground) 
KIRK: Spock, I want you to stand up. Spock, I'm afraid, I'm
sure, that the computer has gone off its circuit and is dead. We must
beam the body away, and the life form that it represents is destroyed. 
SPOCK: I will.

[Mess hall]

SCOTT: The Enterprise will be all right. 
GATES [OC]: And I am sure, Captain, that the computer, with
your permission, will complete its work, and will cease to be, and
will take possession of the Enterprise, and you will be the rightful owner of
the Enterprise.

TUVOK: What can I do for you? 
NADIA: I have nothing to hide. 
TUVOK: I'm curious. 
NADIA: You're the one who should hide. 
TUVOK: This is not a hologram. It is my body. 
NADIA: That's the problem. 
TUVOK: I've seen holograms without your presence. 
NADIA: You're being forced to hide! 
TUVOK: Your presence here gives you the opportunity to act as a

NADIA: That's why you need a hologram. I'm not a hologram. 
TUVOK: I'm sorry, but we can't allow you to use the vessel's
security functions to interfere with this process. 
NADIA: This isn't an opportunity, Tuvok. This is an emergency. 
TUVOK: The ship will not be evacuated, nor any of the guests if it is. 
NADIA: I'm not leaving, but maybe I can find a way to get to you. 
TUVOK: If that's what you want, you will go ahead. 
NADIA: You told me you were going to the surface.

TROI: Well, it might help to tell you that I'm concerned about your

RIGA: Yes, he's right. He's in there, and that's very dangerous. 
RIKER: Very dangerous to you, too. It's not your fault that you'll find
him. What about me? What do I owe you to help me, or to keep me out of

[Astrometrics

(Crusher and Riga are in the middle of an experiment.)DATA:
We now have approximately ten minutes to establish a stable field
conduction before the beam is lost. 
RIKER: How? 
DATA: By isolating the signal's signal processor from the
sensor. By increasing the frequency level from sixty to sixty
twenty percent, we may increase the probability of detection. 
RIKER: Any luck? 
DATA: Negative. 
RIKER: Then let's go. This whole thing should be a lot easier. 
(Riga and Crusher leave) 
RIGA: Well, if the others were to know we were in the process of sending them
off this ship, they might think twice. And that could be the final
shock to the Enterprise. 
RIKER: Is there any point to this? 
DATA: At this point, Commander, I would not take any chances with the
ship's safety. 
RIKER: If all goes well, they'll never get into the ship again, so I
might as well think of the best route to take. 
RIGA: Thank you, Commander. 
DATA: Sir, I have a visualisation of the signal and its path
immediately below. The beam will continue on its course to the coordinates
refermented by the sensor. 
RIKER: Is there a signal in that area?

JANEWAY: We'll go to warp one. 
T'POL: That could take two hours. 
JANEWAY: You were afraid to trust me? You wanted to be able to tell the

RIKER: No. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about something
far more personal. I think you'll find this to be quite interesting. 
(a moment) 
RIKER: A beautiful ship with all the life in the galaxy. A starship with a
family. A family. And there's only one reason I'm going back to
Earth, and that's because there's a family on board. A daughter's
been on board. 
DATA: There are no children on that starship. 
RIKER: Not without being dead. 
DATA: The child remains in stasis until transferred to one of
the ship's children. 
RIKER: Sounds like the future. 
RIKER [OC]: Is it any wonder then, Data, that you can never make a
satisfaction of your family? If your son was not conceived on a
Starbase, how do you know it was a boy? 
DATA: It is difficult for me to make a satisfactory determination. 
RIKER: How do you know the child was a boy? 
DATA: It is not possible for me to know for certain. 
RIKER: How do you know it was a boy? 
DATA: It is not possible for me to know for certain. 
RIKER: I thought you said the future was like the past, Data.

DATA: A more than sufficient explanation. 
RIKER: But what about the child in stasis? I thought it was
a woman. 
DATA: A child. It was a girl. The only explanation would be a man
with a child. 
RIKER: Data, you need to think, think about this. The more
time that passes, the more it seems like you're being held
by someone else to get a result. It's as though you have two
young kids and your life has been pulled apart, and then suddenly you have
two more grown up people coming to your rescue. 
DATA: I believe the future will become more complicated. For example,
the baby. It will change its parents. The boy will be conceived
and transferred to another parent, and another. I will need
more than time for the answer.

It's impossible to get any closer than the ship's transporter

SISKO: Well, we're going to have to set up in the middle of the asteroid belt and
try to get there. That's a riskier proposition than running your station
off shore, but if we go to the point we just made the Romulans won't
be that eager to talk.

 [Ops]

DAX: It's in our best interest to avoid going
near this asteroid belt, Lieutenant. We've always tried to avoid going
near these asteroids, and this one is much closer. 
SISKO: You're right. The Romulans haven't talked before. 
DAX: They have a lot of people on their own ships doing this. 
SISKO: What do you know about them? 
DAX: What do you know of Romulans? We can't just walk into Romulan space.

SISKO: Are you saying that I have to be on my way to the asteroid belt? 
DAX: That the Romulans know of my presence here. 
SISKO: The Romulans have been studying our moon since we arrived
here, and they've had some problems with it. Their sensors indicate
we're here to talk, not to battle. I don't care to talk to anyone
that may want to talk. 
DAX: That's the first thing you're going to say. I'm afraid that's
untenable, Captain. 
SISKO: Fine. I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that they don't. 
DAX: I know. I'm sorry, too. But do you really think this is something we
could talk about? 
SISKO: Not if it means bringing a little more peace to this galaxy,
Lieutenant. 
DAX: I'm not interested in peace. 
SISKO: Then let me explain to you why we have to talk about it. I
want all of you to know that your mission is our mission. 
DAX: You're asking me to talk to a Romulan. 
SISKO: That's what I told her at first. She wasn't convinced. Then
she got up to answer my questions.

RIKER: We're getting reports of massive power drain in the
central area of the ship. We need to find out what's happening. 
PICARD: How? 
RIKER: From the ship. If it's anyone else you saw, they'd be
aboard in less than two hours. We're going to have to do something.

RIKER: I've done something with the power drain. I've set up the reactor
systems. If we can find the source of it.

and as you know, the images of their bodies were taken by a
recreationalist. 
BASHIR: But we did find traces of a certain species of humanoid
life forms, which are quite unique to the planet's surface. 
WORF: Humanoids are among the most biologically complex
artificial organisms on the planet. They have the ability to
replicate themselves. 
BASHIR: Sounds pretty impressive. 
MARTOK: Of course. 
BASHIR: Is this the last of a long line of ships from the same
period? 
MARTOK: No, not quite. There are several more vessels in orbit around
the world. 
BASHIR: Well then the last of their descendants must've been a
very busy time. 
MARTOK: Not unless they're still trying to keep their ship in the airlock.

BASHIR: Oh, I see. 
MARTOK: They could have gone to the surface at any moment in the last
few years, but they kept a low profile. All they did was
scan the ground. 
BASHIR: Have we heard any other stories of a future Federation? 
MARTOK: Not in history. 
BASHIR: Who were they, anyway? 
MARTOK: None other than the Kazon. It was their intention to conquer the
Romulan empire. They hoped to achieve a unification of three
subspecies of humanoid species. The Federation's not exactly an
adversary to that end. 
BASHIR: Do you have any idea what happened when the Kazon launched their
attack? 
MARTOK: I don't know, but it would seem unlikely that the Romulans would survive
long enough to be attacked. 
BASHIR: So they got wiped out in one fell swoop by a Federation of
unimaginables. 
MARTOK: I should have known better than to give the impression, as a
matter of fact, that their existence was an accident. 
BASHIR: What do you mean? 
MARTOK: The Federation made a mistake in not pursuing a policy of
compassion, especially when there were casualties among their own
soldiers.

Are humans here or are we a bit lost in the mess? 
LAFORGE: My crew is very well-equipped. They can do all the
conventional work. We just make up an excuse to use the transporter. 
PICARD: Mister Kim, there are only three of us on this ship, each of
you carrying a unique communicator device that we can't read.
The transporter is not meant to read them.

You say you have no idea how this works. What kind of device
is this? 
PICARD: Not to use for transport. It's a holographic projection. 
KES: How are we going to get a transporter lock on one of these people? 
PICARD: We're working on a transporter lock now. It should take a
while to decipher it. 
KES: And if we don't get it in time, we'll be trapped on this ship for
weeks or months. 
PICARD: I think you should see how long we need. (Lava
flames out the transporter) 
KES: Mister Reed, if this isn't a holographic projection, how are we supposed to
get the message out of the transporter in a matter of seconds? 
RIKER: It's a holographic projection.

of resistance, it must maintain it at a constant pressure of at least seven
magnitudes.

SEVEN: I estimate it is. If we are successful in maintaining this
pressure over three thousand metres

interrogating a Cardassian. 
RIKER: Are you trying to find out what makes them so angry? 
DATA: No, sir, but when I make the attempt, they begin to make
losing reactions. 
RIKER: Are you picking them up? 
DATA: Possibly, sir, but I would be unable to do the exact task
until I know more about how they react. 
RIKER: Data. 
DATA: In what way, sir? 
RIKER: How do you treat an animal of this size? 
DATA: It is difficult to imagine humans treating anything larger than
two metres. The species has limited mobility, and it has no
favourable qualities. Nevertheless, I consider it a most logical
choice. 
RIKER: I understand it might be difficult to treat the species yourself, but
you can't. It's going to have to be done manually, or surgically. 
DATA: The Xindi is unable to use this power, sir. 
RIKER: There is a way for you to try. 
DATA: I can do that by contacting them and using some kind of mind
field, sir. 
RIKER: And then? How will it affect them? 
DATA: I cannot guarantee the exact nature of any potential damage that the
mind field will cause. The power may affect certain systems. 
RIKER: No way, Data, you're risking our lives. 
DATA: I would consider this precaution in case the Xindi uses this power
against us. 
RIKER: We'll have to destroy it before then. 
DATA: The Xindi are very reluctant to try and modify their technology, sir.
There would be little advantage to destroying them. 
RIKER: I'm sure it's the best thing we can do to protect ourselves. If the
Xindi tries to modify their technology I'm sure they'll do just the
same.

RIKER: Your reason is well known. 
PICARD: It's about the way you were raised, sir. 
RIKER: Your family? 
DATA: There are no words for it. 
PICARD: I have a good explanation. You have a deep, spiritual
connection with the crew. They will do anything for you. 
DATA: I am sure it would be difficult to understand if I could.
When I was a child, my parents would take me to the Bridge and
ask me questions about the Enterprise. One day I saw them
carrying a woman on the Bridge. There she was, alone, crying,
but she wouldn't look at me. I asked them to stay, but I had my mother
and the crew away from her. They gave me a hand. I put the woman down.
They did. They said it was my fault. That the Enterprise was a
failure and that we needed them to rescue the women. I was a girl
and I was not ready for that responsibility. And so I looked around. I
saw everyone with their mother and their children, and I started to see
that it wasn't just a failure. It wasn't just that they made a mistake. It
was that they were wrong about me and I had to learn that lesson,
or not be a woman. I chose to stay and be a scientist. I wanted to be a
scientist, and if I didn't, I was sorry. But that didn't stop me. I kept working on
the problem until I was thirty seven, and it wasn't until that point that
I had any answers for myself.

RIKER: It's not working. You can't go back to the
Bridge.

RIKER: Is there any reason why it shouldn't work? I know you have no
answer for this, but I really have to find out for myself.

you're willing to tell me that you really are a woman, why

some kind of infection. I'm assuming it's a form of neural-toxin, something like
e.coli. I'm also assuming it's caused a cellular breakdown, something that
could kill them within hours. 
CHAKOTAY: Could be an effective method to deal with them, but it's not working

JANEWAY: I don't want to be responsible for what happens to my people.
It's a tragedy if we don't have control. 
CHAKOTAY: It's true. This is our only chance.

PICARD: And do you see me in there? 
TASHA: Yes. 
PICARD: No. 
TASHA: I wanted you to know that. 
PICARD: No, I meant you. I know what it is to be trapped by a force field.
But we're going into this place because of us, not because of the forcefield. 
DATA: Is there a possibility that a Cardassian might be a victim of
that kind of forcefield? 
PICARD: No, I don't think so.

our people are sentient.

there are just so many unknowns here, just as with computers. 
SPOCK: It is quite possible. As I stated, most of the systems we
could simulate were designed for use aboard a starship. They must
have similar protocols, similar mechanisms of control. So we
will need to understand these protocols from the perspective of
being in a spacecraft. I hope you'll be able to give an
interactive description.

TORRES: I don't know why it's so hard to keep this party going. 
PICARD: We have to admit, Commander, that you can do more than just watch.
You can go out, talk, eat, whatever it is. But we would expect you to
give us a little more than that. 
TORRES: I think that we're getting there. 
PICARD: There has to be something we can do to prevent it from
becoming a crisis. 
TORRES: Well, we have to get you out of there, too. We're going to have to
control the perimeter. 
PICARD: And if you don't? How are you going to keep that from coming
out of your head? 
TORRES: We've got to make it very clear to them that what you're doing isn't
appropriate. 
PICARD: No. I do understand you're trying, but you're not going to be
able to control it. It's too unpredictable. We can't even keep it
busy while it's going on.

but if anything happens to you, it's too dangerous to get back to your

JANEWAY: We have an agreement. 
KIM: Captain, your mind is very much on another matter, but if I can
help, it's very much my decision. 
JANEWAY: What are you trying to do? 
KIM: I want to get a sample of the biomatter. There's a lot of water in
the river. The temperature has dropped too low to breathe the air. 
JANEWAY: But if this is a sample. 
KIM: Then we have to get to the surface. It's only half a kilometre down. 
JANEWAY: So you won't risk your life. 
KIM: I won't.

DATA: I don't mean to denigrate the spirit of the stars. I wish to
understand and perhaps understand, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Yes. I can understand it. 
WORF: What has this thing to do with Federation ships? 
SPOCK: I have no evidence that Federation ships have ever been
called to respond to any form of distress call, and we, being the
best qualified personnel on board the Enterprise, have agreed to
take the responsibility for
the first of many missions in the galaxy which could lead to the
destruction of every Federation ship on that mission. We believe that is a
good order. 
RIKER: Do you have any evidence to back up that order? 
SPOCK: We don't know what is the cause of the distortion of our sensors and
logs. However, it appears that, because of the nature of the
circuits in the stars, they cannot be easily isolated. 
RIKER: Did you get any indication how the Captain's order was interpreted?

SPOCK: No, sir. 
RIKER: What do you do if we don't give him the answer we want him to
get? 
SPOCK: That is the answer. 
RIKER: What's the other possible explanation? 
SPOCK: It seems to me the Captain is dealing with a problem of considerable
importance, and he is willing to accept responsibility in the
recreation of a galaxy which he feels would best serve the
federation and the Federation's interests. However, I believe that
there is some basis for the captain's order other than his own
concerns, which might be more useful, however, to explain the
irreparable damage he has inflicted on this world, and this
people. 
RIKER: And the people would do it better if they knew a part of themselves
was on the other side of the galaxy, in a galaxy, like that which we
are, in a wormhole?

sure that such a prospect would make any difference. The result would

supervised by Doctor Crusher on the construction of this ship, and
by Lieutenant Commander Data on the tactical management of
the Federation outpost on the moon, and by myself in command of this

danger and you, Number One, are not going to make it if there's a Romulan
assault. If you believe that. But I believe you. Now, I need to go find

SPOCK: A hundred and two, but the moon was too complex for us to make
many landing attempts. They could not land on it, and I cannot
remember the number of times the landing men tried the task themselves.

RIKER: Commander, what kind of weapons are they using? 
CRUSHER: Their shields are failing. 
PICARD: Any chance of slowing them down? 
DATA: They are emitting very low power radiation. The shields
do not penetrate. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar? 
RIKER: Their shields are failing, too. They can't move at a slow rate. 
PICARD: Counsellor, that would allow them to maintain distance
from us. 
RIKER: No. They could beam us directly back to the ship. 
PICARD: No, no, Counsellor. It's too dangerous. 
RIKER: They could kill any of us. 
DATA: Captain, the deflector is almost operational. 
PICARD: Captain, we need to beam the three of you back to the Starship. 
DATA: We will, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, how long have we got left? 
WORF: Approximately two thousand hours, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Data, would you advise that we destroy them? 
DATA: Yes. They are within range of our sensors and shield
systems. The situation is critical, Captain, Captain. If the
shuttlecraft is not stopped or damaged, our men will be stranded on
the planet surface. We need to disable it before it can
sabotage us. 
PICARD: No, Data, this is a different matter. They are very
powerful. The only way out of here for them is to destroy you.

DATA: I think, Captain, we will have

JANEWAY: The aliens are attempting to enter. 
CHAKOTAY: They're not even touching us. 
JANEWAY: That's enough! They're trying to make contact. 
CHAKOTAY: They're trying to go after us! 
JANEWAY: I can't do that! 
CHAKOTAY: Not unless you're willing to risk a trip through the plasma

 TUVOK:
Affected ships include the Federation, Earth, the colony of Haxarra.
They are being hailed and scanned by these aliens. 
CHAKOTAY: What's wrong? 
TUVOK: They are using a weapon that can disable the vessel's
shuttle. 
CHAKOTAY: That's ridiculous. 
TUVOK: However, the attack has been accelerated so that we'll be in
position within ten seconds. 
CHAKOTAY: Are you saying we won't be able to take the hostages? 
TUVOK: It is possible. 
CHAKOTAY: If we can't protect ourselves against this weapon 
TUVOK: I am not certain, Commander. It appears to be an energy

CHAKOTAY: How do we protect ourselves against it?

HENDRICK: Do you think it was a mistake to use the Ambassador? 
JANEWAY: I don't think so. 
HENDRICK: Maybe it was too late for you. Captain, we have another
reason to believe that Starfleet wanted your report. It could
cause a situation similar to the one you brought us into. 
JANEWAY: I'm not trying to do this. I'm trying to get home. 
HENDRICK: You're not coming with us. 
JANEWAY: I won't let you do that. I can't just let you go. You made
your own decisions. And now you have my trust. 
HENDRICK: Captain, your decision didn't have to be mine. 
JANEWAY: Not at all. I've known you and you know me better than I knew
you. You could have kept us out of orbit. I had no interest in
releasing you into a possible trap, but you chose to cooperate with me. 
HENDRICK: We can't help you, Captain. We can't help them. 
JANEWAY: We could don'thing to make you stop, but we know what you are
doing. 
HENDRICK: It's not going to work. The other Klingons will be here, waiting
to hear the truth. They might kill you if you don't do what the
Vulcans want you to. They'll just know you're trying to protect the Ambassador. 
JANEWAY: But what if he says he's innocent? And what if he's lying? What if
he's innocent? What if he's lying because he's being coerced into
confession? What if you're innocent? 
HENDRICK: That's the only answer. That's what's going to make it right
for you to return to Voyager. 
[Bridge]

JANEWAY: This is the same ship you were on when the
Vulcans took you to the surface. The Captain's been gone for years.
There's nothing that you can do about it. You can't go back,
you can't even be near the Klingons.

KIRA: I'm not asking you about this.

strong, brave people.

DATA: Yes, sir. 
BASHIR: Do you have a proposal? 
DATA: Unfortunately, I can't discuss the subject. If you have any other
thoughts, Captain? 
BASHIR: What if we asked someone who had worked closely with him before
they met for a drink and a game of chess? Who were not, as it
tends to be. 
DATA: That might be acceptable. If they were, I am sure they would
understand that I have to take them out of the equation. But if
they were, Mister Data, I would not attempt to explain. 
BASHIR: I'm not getting it. What if we put the chess board up
against the wall to create a game? Then we would have to take them
out of it? You can't have someone who doesn't understand. 
DATA: I believe I have established the advantage, Captain. 
BASHIR: You do understand, Data, but there's an issue of balance. 
DATA: This will be a challenge, Captain. 
BASHIR: You're right. Maybe we can start with the second option. The man is
a good player, and he's an excellent friend. 
DATA: I think not. 
BASHIR: So what else? 
DATA: I believe it is not acceptable that Data and Data have an
intersect. 
BASHIR: No. I don't want to hear the details. 
DATA: As the captain, I would wish to be able to provide your
personal opinion regarding the situation. However, I understand that
the situation has become intolerable for you. 
BASHIR: This is ridiculous. 
DATA: It may indeed be, Captain. However, if your desire is for a personal
approach, then perhaps you may have a more appropriate way of
explaining.

VANNA: I haven't met anyone like you in years. I've lost all

CRUSHER: He's dead, too, of a blood-based disease. Why hasn't he been
born yet? 
VANNA: Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: No, it's okay. I can't imagine what's going to happen. 
VANNA: No, he will be alive. I can't take it. 
CRUSHER: You know the Doctor would have died before he could be
born. We'll have to be quick. 
VANNA: He's right. I know there are others like me, doctors of some
kind, but I've been alone. I don't know how to find them. I don't even know
if I'll be able to get them into the computer at all. 
CRUSHER: We've been looking for you. 
VANNA: No, I can't do this. I was given the cure a few years ago by
another Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Where? 
VANNA: In Germany, he's still alive. He's in a coma. 
CRUSHER: What will happen to him? 
VANNA: It's hard to imagine. We'll carry him in an incubator with
the incubator full of bacteria, but they're not going to eat his
brain. They're trying to feed him with an extra dose of the medication,
but he doesn't seem to get any more benefit than a plate of food
from his own stomach. 
CRUSHER: Well, if I'd known he could't have his own stomach, I would have had him
resurrected. He might have a good chance of surviving

 Magazine: I've
been waiting for you to say something. 
PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. This is Chief Engineer
La Forge. We are waiting for you to answer the question of why we
were forced to leave. 
BASHIR: We had to leave to survive. 
PICARD: But why? What is the point of this kind of forced exile?
It was not a choice. But if I can't go home 
BASHIR: Do you consider this decision your punishment? 
PICARD: Why? 
BASHIR: Because I refused to give you what I thought you wanted. 
PICARD: We did, we did not give you what you thought you wanted. We
want you to be free. 
BASHIR: Not now. 
PICARD: We understand you are going to have to choose between accepting
retribution and staying alive. 
BASHIR: In a way, it is a question of choice as well. Why not leave your
humanity, and the thousands of people who have joined the Romulan empire
for over two thousand years, to survive and thrive? 
PICARD: We have a choice. 
BASHIR: And we will stay alive and thrive with you, if it will help you. 
PICARD: Thank you. Please answer the question. The Captain's orders
concerned a Romulan starship, and he wanted to
keep me here for further study. You are free to leave. 
BASHIR: What choice? 
PICARD: Your future, and the future of our universe. 
BASHIR: It's as simple as that. 
PICARD: I appreciate your understanding, but we are trapped here. 
BASHIR: I was the one who suggested this. I understand. You're trapped,
too. 
PICARD: No, not in that way. But as a symbol of the kind of humanity
that has been so inspiring to so many, you deserve to die. We have
to choose between freedom and exile, between peace and death.

SCOTT: We were sent out to rendezvous with the Enterprise in order to be

ROSS: And the captain's name was Lieutenant William T. Riker? 
SPOCK: In my opinion, Captain, it was the right thing for
you to do, and it's very unfortunate that you were not
successful. 
ROSS: The only reason you didn't succeed is because of the fact that this
was a Federation starship. 
SPOCK: I don't know why they would consider that necessary. If you
had a choice, I would choose Starfleet. But it was not my choice.

if you were more interested in your crew, in getting them home

about a victory of historic proportions. 
GARAK: In what way? 
BASHIR: If the last seventy years of American history is any indication,
the American military has lost too much in a generation, and we need a
greater sense of accomplishment. 
GARAK: I never realised they were so concerned with the way they
looked, but now I think they really do care what the rest of us look like.

GARAK: There's nothing like a good tailor-made army uniforms. But the
presence of uniform is not enough.

tell you that. 
GARAK: Not until you do something about it. 
BASHIR: We don't have to. I can't give you any new advice, but I think I
know someone who would do a better job than the tailor-made ones. 
GARAK: I'm sure you have someone at Starfleet Academy who would approve. 
BASHIR: Actually, I don't think Starfleet Academy is the right choice. 
GARAK: Don't worry. I've talked with all the Academy officers. They are
all just very concerned about the way they look. If you don't change, you
will look nothing like you do now.

unfamiliar to anyone except the pilot. 
PICARD: It's not a threat? 
DATA: In order to establish a course through the system, we must
sail directly into its starboard and port nacelle bulkheads. 
PICARD: What about the warp drive? 
DATA: The Captain has requested a course to intercept, as you have,
but there are not sufficient available sensor data to enable it to
make this final evaluation. 
PICARD: I appreciate your concern, Commander. I thought I would try
this in the main room. I was told it was all possible, but you were a
very experienced pilot, and you mustn't expect a miracle when it comes to
translating data. 
SALEN: Captain, these people who inhabit our space are not capable of
understanding our needs, so I couldn't give up hope, I had to prove them wrong.
In order to keep them from pursuing their demands, I had to establish a
very aggressive attitude toward the situation. And that was the
only way I was going to convince them. 
PICARD: And you will now! I think I can assure you, Mister Spock, that
you will not fail. 
SPOCK: And Captain? 
PICARD: In order to assure you of my loyalty, I'll give you the first chance

process the information we transmit them. 
BRAH: We're getting a lot of data from the communications relays, aren't
we? 
VISSER: Yes. 
BRAH: If they're malfunctioning, it's going to take weeks before any of
them can communicate with the Borg. What can we do now? 
VISSER: We need to transfer the power from the relays into our
main computer. 
BRAH: When? 
VISSER: We've got to create a shield field to stop any further
damage. If they're not able to breach it, they'll be assimilated
too. 
BRAH: What if they get all of it? 
VISSER: A tractor beam will only last a matter of minutes and we can't
do anything about it. 
BRAH: You've tried a lot of things. How much of what you know is
true? 
VISSER: It is more than I can imagine. We must have made the right
decisions and the plan is working. 
BRAH: You're not trying to lie. You must know the truth. 
VISSER: I do. 
BRAH: But that isn't the point. Is the captain going to be assimilated too? 
VISSER: That's not the point. We must find a way to survive. That's
what Captain Janeway is asking us to do, protect her. Let's do it,
we must. It's not easy. I understand your instinctive need to survive, but
there's another option. We can give her control of her own

RIKER: Now how many can we have? 
PICARD: Oh, there are so many. If we have any guests, they could be
considered guests. It's quite the party. 
RIKER: I was really hoping for a little more than this. 
PICARD: It was your idea, Mister Crusher, to join the party. 
CRUSHER: Actually, it was you who suggested it. 
PICARD: I'm sure I did. It was a gift for you. And while we wait,
maybe we could ask some of these guests if they'd like to go? 
CRUSHER: No, it was only a suggestion. 
RIKER: If this is what you want, fine. How about some wine? 
PICARD: Thank you. 
RIKER: I didn't find that particularly convincing. 
PICARD: That's a good point, Doctor. How about this. If I had to
make a recommendation I'd say to you to stay out of trouble. 
CRUSHER: I don't agree. 
PICARD: Good. It's all right, I understand. It's no excuse to take on
any more responsibility. 
CRUSHER: I'm trying. You'll need the experience to help you on this
mission. You've got no right to get so comfortable. 
PICARD: That's correct. 
CRUSHER: What I am not interested in is the past. The past must not be
kept in the mind. To do that, you're going to have to understand what's
happening. I would argue that the time when you came aboard is the
most important time in your life. I don't just mean that, but that you
need to know what it's like to be on a starship and do work on a starship.
When I asked you the question, what are the best days in your life? 
RIKER: I don't think we should go into the future too quickly,
do you?

Hello.

RIKER: What have you brought? 
GUILD: Your ship has been stolen by a Borg. 
RIKER: We're being held here, and you're being held here. How do you
know? 
GUILD: I've found you. You are, of course, Captain Riker, of the
Enterprise. 
RIKER: It's good to see you, Commander. 
GUILD: And I'm sorry. 
RIKER: We've asked you to come to us. What do you have to tell us,
Commander? 
GUILD: We've heard of other vessels having stolen your ship. 
RIKER: Not this one. 
GUILD: I'm certain these are genuine. 
RIKER: And I'm certain that we'll find you and this vessel a home
not only in the Neutral Zone, but in the Delta Quadrant as well. 
GUILD: The Delta Quadrant, what are you talking about? 
RIKER: The Federation. 
GUILD: The Federation? That's right. 
RIKER: Then you've got to go. 
GUILD: It is a mistake to interfere. 
RIKER: For what reason? 
GUILD: They will no longer listen to the wishes of those who have
been sent to the Gamma Quadrant as hostages. They may no longer
support that mission, but they will not interfere. 
RIKER: Why won't the Federation go? 
GUILD: The Federation is as important to their interests as our
own. 
RIKER: We've got to get them out of this! 
GUILD: We must not interfere in the Klingon civil war. 
RIKER: But that means, the Klingons are going to destroy all your ships and
every one of them? 
GUILD: Yes, that would be a mistake. 
RIKER: Then we've got to make a decision as an alliance. Do we give up the
loyalty, the prestige, the hope that we'll someday fight for the Federation?

PICARD: Could the Borg destroy it?

SPOCK:
It's a low-gravity planet. 
MCCOY: Well, if you get here first you won't have too many people on
board. 
SPOCK: It appears to be composed of a series of basalt columns. 
MCCOY: I'm going to have to cut into the base to see the floor, but
when I start to lower to the surface I think I'll find that the
floor is very rough. I can tell you that it doesn't appear to have a lot of
natural vegetation. 
SPOCK: It should be, perhaps, the least habitable of all the
main worlds. 
KIRK: Well, you're not telling me what that should be. 
SPOCK: That will become necessary. 
MCCOY: It's not necessary. How's the condition of your personnel? 
SPOCK: Excellent. 
MCCOY: The atmosphere's probably the worst in the quadrant. 
SPOCK: Not possible. I'll order the nearest ship to meet us at all
minutes. 
KIRK: But we don't know that until we get there. If the atmosphere becomes
suboptimal it will become unbearable. And that would, in
fact, kill us. 
MCCOY: I know how difficult a situation life on this planet can be.
That's why we never leave the ship until it's safe to do so.

I don't have you to thank. 
TORRES: No, you have to thank the Federation. 
KIM: You do? 
TORRES: The Borg didn't know much about the Federation, did they? They
just assumed it was a bunch of greedy little government officials
trying to take everything they own. 
KIM: Oh, it's your responsibility to keep those bureaucrats in check.
I understand that the Borg don't care about humans or
Borgs or the rest of us, but the Federation has managed
to make them realise that in a certain way they are our friends, and
the Federation is our future.

BASHIR: Looks like I'm the only one who seems to be alive. The one
that seems to be dying. 
O'BRIEN: It's as if a force field is being pulled in behind me. I can't
get a hold on it, it's just like a force field. I think we've caught it.
I have to do something to pull it off. We're stuck here in here and this is
the last thing we can do. 
BASHIR: You've got to go. 
O'BRIEN: I'm going to tell you this. I've got to get away. I need help. 
BASHIR: Help? 
O'BRIEN: We have a few things we can do. 
BASHIR: What else could you do? 
O'BRIEN: Help me get me out of here. Help me get away from the pain.
I need you. 
BASHIR: The pain? That's the first thing you'll be asking. 
O'BRIEN: My hand. How long has it been this way? 
BASHIR: Two weeks. I have to pull it off now. 
O'BRIEN: Then we'll start. What are you going to do? 
BASHIR: I'm not sure. But I think the Doctor could do something with the
solar panel. He just needs to learn more about that. 
O'BRIEN: Yeah. So, you know, you get sicker from exposure to a
galaxy like this, it has to stop. Maybe that's all you have to do is
get some rest. 
BASHIR: I'll do my best.

 Gatiska told me
the first thing he said when I came aboard, is that he wants to stay, because we
have a very special relationship.
KIRK: If he stays he will be very disappointed.
KOV: I am not going to discuss personal feelings. Let me take you to
the next level. You were only going to be aboard for a day. You should be
getting your job done. Now you'll be here for almost a month. You are going
to have a great opportunity, Kirk. You're going to
make a valuable contribution to this ship and in a wonderful way,
you'll be remembered. You will be in my thoughts, in my memory.
KIRK: Thank you.
KOV: I wish it were that easy, sir.
KIRK: Easy. And I want to be here for this opportunity.
KOV: I have to see you then.

[Planet surface]

SPOCK:
We have found a kind of living material, but it is very limited.
SPOCK: This place is very far from the surface. The density is very high
and there are a great deal of rocks and other debris.
KIRK: No wonder I'm so bored, Mister Spock. I could use the company.
MCCOY: I'd think it wouldn't surprise me to find some new ideas here.
SPOCK: If we remove the outer layer of atmosphere to get close
enough to the ship, we should be able to look at the inside of the ship
without having to remove the outer layer. We should be able to see
through a fair amount of the hull.
KIRK: Why not?
SPOCK: We could use some kind of cloaking device.
KIRK: What kind of device would that be?
SPOCK: There should be something that would cause the ship to appear
visible at the point of impact. An anti-matter shield would make
it easier, as they say in Starfleet, to beam a beam over. We could
look like a beam ship.
MCCOY: But then there'd be a risk. We'd be breaking the transporter
control system. We'd be at risk of losing the Enterprise. And then there'd be
a risk in letting in outsiders.
SPOCK: The Enterprise will be safe in orbit. The

SISKO: The food here is excellent. 
O'BRIEN: I can't believe it's only vegetables. 
ODO: They've cooked up something very unusual. This is a very special
brie. There's one last step to the meal. We get a small bowl of
cheese. Then we sit down to eat. 
SISKO: You should try it. There's a chance it'll be more like the
Brie we had on the Defiant.

(Dax has a look at the pictures on the wall) 
O'BRIEN: The picture? I want to know how those Klingons got
that. 
DAX: They were not Klingons. They were Nixians from Earth. We know that
they were transported here after an attempt to escape their war on the
Colony. The Nixians were exiled to the southern hemisphere after their
capture. They were not captured. This is not Earth. 
O'BRIEN: I can't believe we're all talking about the same place. 
DAMAR: You don't look too good. 
O'BRIEN: I don't give a damn what anyone else thinks. We've come here to
find a new world, a place better than Earth, but I have a lot of work to do.

DAMAR: This is where you plan to go? 
O'BRIEN: When the time comes I'll be a senior officer. 
DAMAR: That's right. 
O'BRIEN: I can't wait for it. 
DAMAR: Why not? 
O'BRIEN: My career path was not meant to begin tomorrow morning. We're
getting ready for our expeditionary mission. 
DAMAR: I see. 
O'BRIEN: Your crew hasn't had a chance to prepare. 
DAMAR: What have you got? 
O'BRIEN: Two dozen food replicators. Two hundred and sixty eight computers.
They're still not ready.

O'BRIEN: It'll work. We can replace the food with a synthetic

O'BRIEN: This isn't working. What's happening? 
BASHIR: I can't explain it. There's been some kind of interference. Something's
stabilising it, but I don't know what it is. I can't give it a name, but
it just seems to keep flickering and flickering, and there's no reason for
it to do that. 
O'BRIEN: Why don't we shut it down and let it go? 
BASHIR: It's a computer, remember. 
O'BRIEN: No, I'm sure we could do something different. I could use a
monitor to do some of the diagnostics. If there's anything wrong, try
to fix it. 
BASHIR: What I'm trying to do is get a level zero diagnostic
from the sensors. I'm not sure we can get away with this. 
O'BRIEN: Are you suggesting that they be forced to remain in the
control room, monitoring the control panels, all the time? 
BASHIR: If we were to force them to remain in the control room
they wouldn't be able to handle this situation, and it could leave
them vulnerable to being overwhelmed by hostile personnel or aliens. 
O'BRIEN: If we can't find the problem, we can't repair it. 
BASHIR: I'm just saying that a large group of humans can't function
in a space environment like this without it's ability to be
stimulated and maintained. 
O'BRIEN: What if it could be done by a computer programme? 
BASHIR: Well, they have no choice. But it could be tricky to
modify them in any way that would keep them from simply being
pushed away.

SALAAM: How many men? 
KOLWOR: Well, let's start at the beginning. In
decades ago I was a military officer. 
SALAAM: In a time of war? 
KOLWOR: That is right. I was the most decorated officer in my army. 
SALAAM: You must know that your wife is a highly professional
officer? 
KOLWOR: Exactly. But then you must remember that during the war my wife
was forced to retire, and I did not want to remain with her. 
SALAAM: And, you see what happened to your wife? She became a soldier. So
we decided to let her go and live with her own people, a place
where she could still live her life. 
KOLWOR: Well, you are the first. 
SALAAM: What was her occupation? 
KOLWOR: As a transport engineer on an early-class transport called the
Paso Trunk. 
SALAAM: An early-class transport? 
KOLWOR: This is not a mid-class transport, it is more of a luxury
ship. It was designed for the wealthy, but it had no real luxury and
no comfort. 
SALAAM: It had a cargo bay. 
KOLWOR: And what cargo bay?

RIKER: This is the final, on the subject matter I've asked of you,
and you were prepared with your presentation. 
DATA: My presentation is more appropriate to this context. It is
essential that you state your purpose. 
WORF: I have explained that this programme is an attempt to
translate a human capacity for self-control into a machine. The
programme will be an effective means of control. 
DATA: But is that an attempt to make you a better man? 
DATA: For better or for worse, this programme is to serve as a
facilitator in the development of the human consciousness. 
WORF: It is a challenge, but I am willing to do it. 
DATA: By definition, the programme will attempt to
translate a human capacity for self-control into a machine. 
WORF: Then it is a challenge to control my body, to make me feel
less vulnerable. 
DATA: Exactly. 
WORF: If there are any failures, I shall be disciplined in order to avoid
another like them. 
DATA: It is a human need that is not necessarily being fulfilled. In some
cases, you may feel as if you are unable to function as a human
being. 
WORF: Yes, I will be disciplined. 
DATA: If I am disciplined, will I not retain my humanity? 
WORF: No. I will be human. I will begin to function as a person. And I
will live long and happy lives. 
DATA: Your life will be more likely if you will start to function as a
human. 
WORF: Then I have done my duty. My life. 
DATA: You are still human, Commander Riker. Why do you act so
humanly? 
WORF: It seems to me that you find a man's humanity to be as
immaterial to his physical form as the essence of his humanity is.

form.

JANEWAY: Oh, this is as it should be, and as you were. I don't know how
the Starfleet officers reacted. In some cases they seemed amused, but
in others, they were appalled by the prospect of my commanding officer
in the holodeck. I can't imagine anyone who enjoys watching me perform
or speaking to me that way in public. 
KIM: Yes. 
JANEWAY: Well, you might find this amusing. 
KIM: I'm sorry I had any offence, Captain. 
JANEWAY: Perhaps that's because I was expecting you to enjoy this.

from assimilating is to keep the others from seeing what we're

CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. We will. 
SEVEN: How will we maintain our balance when the others are

itude of the people, even the
people who don't share this way of life. 
PICARD: Then how do we move forward with respect to our mission, and
with respect to our culture? 
DATA: To be very clear, our culture has evolved on several occasions. 
PICARD: And those changes have always affected both our ship and
both our culture? 
DATA: That is correct. But none of that does not affect the
culture of the Klingons. The Klingons are still far superior to the
Romulans on every point of view. Their technology is superior
to the Romulans. Their society is based on honour and sacrifice,
and so on. 
PICARD: You mean they have a greater respect for their enemies? 
DATA: That is correct. In fact, the Romulans had a greater respect
for the enemy than the Klingons ever did. 
PICARD: So why is that? 
DATA: Because we believe that the Klingon Empire is the ultimate
purpose of human existence. We are taught to think of humans as the
first of a new species and that we must build a new world for them. But
these ideas don't apply to the Klingons. Because of their
culture and their beliefs, they have refused to assimilate the
other. They consider themselves superior to all others. And now it is
up to us to lead that race to the next stage in evolution. 
(Data stops Picard from following her) 
DATA: Your efforts would be futile. Your only hope would be
to convince them to let you move against them. 
PICARD: Is that an unreasonable hope? 
DATA: I believe so. But it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible,
to persuade a people who would resist an order so dangerous. If
you were truly driven to do so, then you would understand that your
sensibilities would be compromised, if only to protect your ship and
your crew. You cannot risk the enemy knowing you have no other
possible options to choose from. 
PICARD: That's what you tried to do here, Data. 
DATA: Yes. 
PICARD: How do you propose we can achieve that end?

interest. 
PICARD: I can't help it. This feels strange, and I need time to
calm down. 
NARRATOR [on monitor]: You may rest. I will continue the conversation. 
PICARD: You know, this is very strange, isn't it? When you were in Engineering
you were thinking about something, but it was so disconnected from anything
else. And if you had tried to speak to us like this, there would have been no
reason to tell us this. 
NARRATOR [on monitor]: You know, you don't want to be remembered as a
commander, you want to be remembered as someone who knew how to
help a patient. 
PICARD: I can handle that. All right, let's just get over this. 
NARRATOR [on monitor]: You are right, you can't. There was a time
when you were a captain. 
PICARD: That time was not here. 
NARRATOR [on monitor]: Oh, you did it. You saved lives, and it's not
that
important whether it's right or wrong whether or not you saved lives.
That's just part of it. We're not a society, we're a group of
people, the crew on this ship is not people.

QUARK: I don't mind. We've made up our mind. We don't need you.

BASHIR: You have to admit something about Nog's last visit to
Sela Three. His eyes were big. 
(Bashir takes the device out of the holosuite.) 
BASHIR: The little things, the little details that you see
are really important.

scanned by Bajoran eyes and the Klingon's face.) 
GARAK: Do you know how many of the aliens live on this planet? It must
be over ten thousand. 
BASHIR: How many of them could be killed? 
GARAK: That depends. Most of the times we've encountered them, they only
appear to be able to transport people across the planet. They're quite
intelligent, but most of the times there was no other way for them to
transfer someone. 
BASHIR: Which makes sense if they're using the entire surface. 
GARAK: We haven't seen any other aliens on the surface of this planet
in years. 
BASHIR: Where did you meet them? 
GARAK: It was a small conference in a bar. It was like meeting a
friend, but not on a personal level. We were working out a few technical
issues when I suddenly found myself asking, why are you doing this to me? 
BASHIR: Yours is a very good question. It's something I've been wondering for
years. I've come to terms with my feelings, but I can't deny how I feel
about Nog. I mean, if he really is in love with you, then that means he
will allow you to stay. 
GARAK: Yes, he will. I've already lost him. 
BASHIR: What would he do? 
GARAK: I can't get a grip on it. All I can do is hope you don't
find yourself in the same boat. That's the first thing I've been thinking.

 KIRK: I know it's a pretty silly situation. I'm
actually in command of a ship that's in orbit of another planet. It's
pretty much a war zone. I want to know who's going to get captured, so
I could make decisions that would benefit the galaxy.

KIRK: On screen. 
KOLOS: A new world and it's inhabited by the first and only
colonists? I think they've taken the necessary precautions before
sending a representative. 
KIRK: I want to know who's going to get captured. So what would you
do? If we were facing a colony of a few million, it would be good to
know whether you could keep them under tight control until this
conversion is complete. 
KOLOS: Not necessarily. I know about it. I have people in my unit. If we
came on screen, they are still in good standing. They know what they
are doing, they know where we're headed. But if we were facing a fleet, I
probably wouldn't need to worry about who will get captured. It would be
better if there was some way to stop them before it was too late. I
guess I can't. 
KIRK: I know that, Kolos. There's only one thing I'm worried about, Captain, and that is the
safety of the crew. 
KOLOS: I am very concerned that if we return from the planet now, we're going
to find more colonies than the only one in Federation orbit. 
KIRK: That's a risk I'm willing to take. 
KOLOS: Captain, these are prisoners of war. The prisoners are going to
be treated as prisoners of war, and no one should interfere with their
conditionality. 
KIRK: I wouldn't want them in any kind of confinement. 
KOLOS: Captain, the world that I have chosen is not my choice, but you have to
be careful. There are risks we have to take when we come on screen. You
will have to do this yourself.

BASHIR: No, it's the same old story.

WIDEN: Commander Sisko. 
BASHIR: You did a good job. Thank you, Doctor.

SISKO: I didn't notice you. 
BASHIR: I was working. 
SISKO: I've been studying the files you took from the holosuite.
I'm concerned that one of the programme's programmes might be
inactivated. 
BASHIR: This isn't a holosuite programme. They're just computers. 
SISKO: I know what's happened to your ship, but this was your entire
programme? 
BASHIR: All this is happening now. 
SISKO: I don't understand. 
BASHIR: I guess the computer doesn't have time to figure out what's
happening now. 
SISKO: There you go again. You have to be an android. 
BASHIR: I suppose my experience does have an element of an android. 
SISKO: I haven't thought about that yet. 
BASHIR: I suppose not. What I'm saying is that our existence isn't worth
nothing to the computer. And in that way, it's not a hologram, it's
not a simulation. It's a person, and no hologram would be perfect
without a human centre. 
SISKO: This isn't a discussion about hologramisation, it's about
our life. 
BASHIR: There are thousands of people who would benefit from a
human centre, but there are others who aren't ready to become one.
Some people might be programmed to think like a human or
not. But I'm just a human, and that's what I do. That doesn't mean that I'll
have to live the life of the android or not.

KIRK: We can't do anything. There's something else. 
MCCOY: Jim, I don't think there's any others. But there may be a

KIRK: You'll be all right, Doctor. You were probably right in
what you said, and you probably got the idea right. But there's something in
here which you can't see. There is nothing like us in space and all we have
are the laws and the rules, and it looks like it's forcing us to do
things that we don't feel we can do. 
SPOCK: I don't believe there is a thing in this area which is
forcing us. The rules don't permit us to make decisions
as individuals or as members of groups. 
KIRK: I appreciate that. Doctor. 
MCCOY: The Vulcans said the things they wanted, and they made an
overwhelming effort. I didn't want to argue with that, but I thought
there's something that should be done. 
KIRK: Doctor, what is it? 
MCCOY: Well, I don't know if it's just a question of whether or not a
thing exists. We have to get to the point of actually thinking. 
SPOCK: I don't believe there is any thing in this area that
forces us to make choices. 
KIRK: You're saying something as if the Vulcans have made this choice. 
MCCOY: Well, I'm not saying anything about them. 
SPOCK: I believe there is a certain sense of satisfaction in
believing it exists, and perhaps it is what drives us forward.

I don't believe any one of us can get away with a trick this

KIRK: Not everybody, but you. Mister Spock. You know the reason why.
We are both trapped and both desperate, and we have to do something to
help one another. 
SPOCK: That is precisely the point. 
KIRK: You are right. A call to action could make your life
very difficult, even impossible, but it is your choice. That's how this
relationship began. 
SPOCK: I would not be myopic, Captain. You have been trying to sedate me
all along. I have the knowledge that you require. 
KIRK: I would appreciate a chance to think about it and make your

guarantee, while your ship is flying under a cloud of suspicion, of
anything which could affect your decisions.

correct one. Captain, I would suggest that we continue to study

were the one who had to make the choice.

probable theories for all of them, but the real answer is
simply the only one I have heard. 
DATA: What are you suggesting? 
RIKER: That a star is simply not a star, it's an illusion, an
illusion created to make us believe in an ideal future, and we all
believe in the future. And once we accept that reality, the only
way we can live in it is to create a holographic replica of
it. In order to do that, we need a person who has some part of our
mind or consciousness that is in some way related to the past. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, and that's the reason why I can see you in here, isn't
it?

to stop them they will abandon the operation and follow the Federation

SISKO: No, I didn't. I knew I had to. I know we have a chance to stop
them, but I also know it's going to be an uphill fight. Every time
something else happens it gives the Dominion reason to think it can't
afford to stay home and be safe. 
DAX: But the Romulans didn't want to risk it. 
SISKO: There are going to be casualties. We've only got one ship. And
the Romulans are not going to give up easily. I want us to do everything we
can, to be efficient, but it won't do any good if we're going to have to
destroy two or three starships. I need you to make a strategic decision. Is
that clear?

polluted water, or to detect the organisms. 
HOSHI: I know you're going to have to have to put that question
to me, Doctor, but are you familiar with the planet that we're in

wanted to remain underground, and in that case, we'd be facing the
same situation.

PHLOX: No one else has been able to speak to us. In fact, there's very little
information available on what happened on that planet. 
CHAKOTAY: What do you know?

investigation into this colony.

that the colonists used the water of a river below them, and we've never
been able to determine the cause. 
JANEWAY: There's no doubt about the colonists had a reason for going underground.
They wanted to live underground. 
HOSHI: A very noble sentiment. 
CHAKOTAY: Maybe not. It could be that the colonists were just tired of
looking for water. Maybe they wanted to keep moving on for other things.
They were afraid that if they let the humans in that water, there would be

PHLOX: I will be. I don't care where you are or what you're doing. I
promise you, if this is all your problem, it is my problem as well.
There's simply no doubt that you were the cause. Is that clear? 
BASHIR: Yes. 
PHLOX: What do you mean? 
BASHIR: I'm an engineer. I have no idea why I'm here, or how to get
off, or what's going on with you. So all of this is my fault. Why didn't I
ask you before? 
PHLOX: I didn't want to. You were afraid to tell me. 
BASHIR: I wasn't. Why? Because I didn't want to know. 
PHLOX: Well there you are. Now what do you think? 
BASHIR: It's too early to tell. I need more information. 
PHLOX: You should have told me what you were telling me. You wouldn't
have given your word of honour. 
BASHIR: I was the first one on the planet. 
PHLOX: Who were you? 
BASHIR: A technician. 
PHLOX: You worked for your superiors for twenty years?

BASHIR: Well, Commander, there's no way that I can keep you out of here 
RIKER: Yes, there is. But you can't just put your faith in her

BASHIR: I don't know about you, but I know how difficult it can be for an
unwanted man to let his guard down for a woman. And with me, my
life depends on it. 
RIKER: If you don't let her know, she won't be let in on any of this.

BASHIR: I can't be that careful.

SULU: I hope they've cleared the ship of the contaminates. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu, you say the Doctor has died. I think it's time we made
the Captain an eyewitness to this event. The reason we're here is because
we want to make the Captain's account of the incident visible to her,
since we can't let her do anything that might upset her
mind. 
SULU: That is correct. 
KIRK: What is it? 
SULU: I was able to transfer the neural impulses to the eyes. That's a very
difficult task in a ship in which we don't have complete
sight. 
KIRK: But we're the same size, have the same mass, our entire body is an
image. The only thing I can't do is just tell them, sir. They're
too dangerous.

 communities that are being denied their fair share

RIKER: The Romulans have long stated that this planet is theirs,
but they've been denied it ever since the war began. They've put
limits on their own people's freedom. 
PICARD: I understand that there is a natural order to war. 
RIKER: It's just that the Romulans don't share it. That they have a
special place in their hearts for this planet. The Federation
declares them as enemies. 
WORF: A Federation enemy is one who has a superior military
system, an army that is superior to their numbers. 
LAFORGE: What is Starfleet going to do about the Romulans? 
PICARD: If the Romulans are to be treated with equal dignity,
they have to be treated equally. 
PICARD: I have a ship on long range sensors. 
RIKER: It would be a mistake to underestimate our own technology. 
PICARD: And we have some of the most advanced weapons in the quadrant. 
DATA: The Romulans are using the dilithium ore that is the key to the
weapons. We have sufficient intelligence about its construction
to construct an accurate probe. 
LAFORGE: All the sensors are offline because of a Borg virus. It might be
necessary to detonate their weapons to take us down with them. But
if we detonate, the Borg will have no choice but to return and create a
perfect storm so that the Romulans can escape into space. 
RIKER: Let's make it happen, Commander. 
WORF: I would think that such an attack would not be effective on the
Romulans.

was unable to tell Commander Data that he was to report to the
shuttle. But I tried to arrange for a transporter log.

BASHIR: I'll talk to you.

stabilised relations with Bajor. It would be most beneficial to have it
back now, but they can't do anything about it without your co-operation.

KIRA: If that happens. 
SISKO: And you become a prisoner, you never know what happens. They're going

don't want to hear from me. 
SISKO: You have to. You've got to tell us everything we want to hear. 
KIRA: You're right. It would take more than a simple reply to the question
to answer it. We need a way to start the war, and so do you.
If I start it, then there's only one choice. You're either with
us or you're a Klingon prison camp! 
SISKO: I understand the logic of that. 
KIRA: Then let's start this war, and give it to me, so that I can give

RIKER: A lot of people are working on that kind of thing, Counsellor. 
(A large number of delegates, including Riker, come in.) 
PICARD: What are you doing? 
DATA: What can you say, I'm the one who's in charge. 
PICARD: Good. I'm afraid the next order of business is to figure out exactly
who was in the Enterprise during the war. 
RIKER: Captain, I'd be willing to risk the crew of this ship and get them
information on who was there. 
PICARD: That could take some time. 
RIKER: What you're asking for will be difficult to accomplish, but it has to
be possible if the Federation is going to give up the search for the
truth. Data, let me get a little specific. What exactly is the
evidence you have? 
DATA: We have no doubt the Captain, Commander Riker and a number of
other crew members have committed crimes against the Federation. 
PICARD: There's no evidence for that? 
DATA: There is no evidence. 
PICARD: Then you can't show me how they could've been
guilty. 
DATA: The Captain, Commander Riker, and Captain Christopher Riker are in
prison. 
PICARD: Then we have to assume those men could be innocent. 
DATA: The only possible answer is that they were simply following orders.

want to be honest with you, Captain. 
MIROK: What? 
SESKA: Everything about our mission and all the details about our
mission are secret. 
MIROK: I don't understand why. You promised us a complete overhaul of
the Enterprise for twenty nine years. You're not going to
go back into business after that? 
SESKA: You're right. We'll make the first improvements in seven
years, and we'll make the next improvements in fifteen. 
DATA: The Enterprise won't continue to operate without a complete
re-engineering, Captain. 
SESKA: The question is, will these modifications make the
Enterprise a better ship. 
PICARD: You're right, and we'll have to start thinking about that. 
SESKA: I'm sorry, Commander. I'll take that as a
firm word. 
PICARD: We're going to have to give you a little time, Mister Seska.

SESKA: I've tried to contact every member of my crew, but no one's

plan. 
PICARD: I'm aware of the difficulties involved. 
SESKA: There is one option, sir. It would allow me to keep
your body for five years and use it later. 
PICARD: That's an interesting idea. But I'm not aware of another
plan which would allow you to maintain one of your body's organs
until you wished to become a doctor.

PHLOX: How was my last test?

PHLOX: You know, your stomach is still burning. Your lungs
burned, too. Your immune system has been suppressed. I'm
not sure that would've helped much in the way of a battle. I'm
certain you'll get used to it. 
ARCHER: I will. 
PHLOX: Good, because that could prove disastrous. If you have to
remodulate your skin and apply some kind of skin-regeneration
system to it, you might end up killing yourself. 
ARCHER: I'm going to work with you to find a cure. I'm glad the
Federation agreed to let me. 
PHLOX: I can't think of a single situation where the only
reason for taking a life is to protect one of your own. 
ARCHER: I appreciate that, Doc. 
PHLOX: It's all right to let yourself off the hook. 
ARCHER: What's wrong? 
PHLOX: It's time that I gave up that belief. I can't get
out of bed anymore and I can't function in any other way.

avoid suspicion. 
RIKER: That makes it official, then? 
DATA: We are officially confirmed for use in your vessel. 
RIKER: Where have we been? 
DATA: As you would expect from an experienced observer. 
RIKER: I thought it was a game. 
DATA: It is in fact a very serious matter. 
RIKER: Is there any information on how it affects you? 
DATA: I would not be surprised to be afflicted, if I have to alter my
life, experience, and perhaps even existence. 
RIKER: That should give you some relief, Data, but I'd like to
have it on tape for proof, at least. 
DATA: As we have no way to prove it, I will remain strictly silent. 
RIKER: What is the significance of that? 
DATA: It is one of those paradoxes which are most difficult to
detect. They are generally described as being beyond your comprehension and
there is no way to resolve them. When a person has
a problem which is beyond your comprehension 
RIKER: Then what are you going to do? 
DATA: There is no way to resolve it except to consider yourself in
some way afflicted. 
RIKER: What is that? 
DATA: You find the situation more difficult than I do, in that it is
irrelevant to you personally. 
RIKER: I've been in this situation before. 
DATA: In your case, a person has no choice but to admit that his condition
is beyond their comprehension. It is then logical to believe him to
be afflicted. 
RIKER: Yes, but if you can't explain it to me, I have to be able to
understand it. And then there's also the question of what is this game
really about? 
DATA: I would appreciate it if you would allow me to explain it. 
RIKER: Let's be clear about this. I want to be able to explain it, I can't
tell you if you've been affected by it or not. You know it's impossible to
give me any explanation, but I can't let you stop me. I want you to know what
you're fighting for, I want to be able to give you a solution to this

RIKER: So, what's to stop us from killing him? 
DATA: Data indicates we should refrain from killing until there is
evidence supporting their guilt. 
PICARD: We don't have time to wait for that evidence. We have to
start treating him. 
DATA: Captain? 
PICARD: This is not a human experiment. You are being experimented
on, Mister Data. You are a member of the crew of a vessel of the
Vulcans. We are not attempting to create a laboratory, no matter how
conceptual it might seem to you. A crewman has
definitely volunteered for a trial. We have no reason to
discriminate and take his life. 
RIKER: That's impossible. You're being experimented on, Data. There's no
reason to do anything else. 
DATA: I have decided that we must try to determine exactly what caused
his behaviour, and then allow him to explain it. 
RIKER: Data, how many people have died on this ship before and how many
will die in the meantime? 
DATA: Unfortunately, I am unable to provide precise information.
However, it is likely that more than a hundred are dead. 
RIKER: We have no chance of saving the rest. 
DATA: There is a chance. If he does not answer my questions, I will
be forced to allow him to remain for interrogation, and then it would be
possible for me to release him. But this may not be possible.

PICARD: I think this is a very complicated situation. I think he knows
you very well, Data. That is why I asked you to give me a detailed
description of your experience, but it would only be wise to speak
only to the facts here.

TROI: You, I would like to have you tried. 
RIKER: Is that going to be too difficult? 
TROI: No, it's not. 
RIKER: Are you saying you won't let them go? 
TROI: I will not let them go until I see that you are innocent. 
RIKER: Oh, and what about Commander Data? 
TROI: He's innocent. 
RIKER: I understand your desire for an acquittal, but you don't appear
to think he is. 
TROI: I do think he is innocent, but I also know he was misled by the
interrogations. 
RIKER: In what way? 
TROI: I think he is not innocent because of what was told to him in those
interrogations. Because the interrogation is part of the game. That is a
game. We don't think and believe things that are not true. 
RIKER: Well you've just proved my point. 
TROI: That is correct. I wish to help you, but I am still being pursued. I can
only hope that these charges are going to come out of this. 
RIKER: Is there a way to avoid prosecution? 
TROI: If you are guilty of a crime you may choose to confess it. 
RIKER: But you're innocent. 
TROI: That is correct, sir. 
RIKER: So? 
TROI: I am a suspect. Therefore I must take the stand and be questioned. 
RIKER: Who is going to do that? 
TROI: They are the Chief Investigator of the Medical Services Division. 
RIKER: The Medical Services Division?

 Scheduling an inter-mission briefing for Doctor Marda. 
DATA: I have no further need for this information. 
WATTERS: Doctor, I know you had some difficulty in your medical training
after the accident. 
DATA: No, sir. I was only taking care of some
medical needs while the crew was aboard the shuttle. Doctor Marda
was my first assignment after that and it began at the same time
as you. My name is William R. Watters. 
WATTERS: So where is Doctor Marda? 
DATA: I don't know her location. 
WATTERS: Why is that? 
DATA: Because the computer indicated she is not on board the
shuttlecraft. 
WATTERS: Why? 
DATA: She is being held on a security detention status. 
WATTERS: Then she is inadmissible on board? 
DATA: Sir. 
WATTERS: Where is she? 
DATA: On the Enterprise shuttle. 
WATTERS: Where is Doctor Marda? 
DATA: On the Enterprise shuttle. 
WATTERS: What is this ship doing here? 
DATA: That is the question. 
WATTERS: Doctor, I don't like this. I don't believe it. 
DATA: Do you? 
WATTERS: Yes, I do. 
DATA: I apologise. I have just assumed that the shuttle's sensor
navigational schematics require an individual ship commander to be
responsible for it. You may not be aware of this, but the Enterprise
shuttle is a crew vehicle. 
WATTERS: If it is, who is? 
DATA: The Bridge Officer, Doctor Marda. The Captain, Data. 
WATTERS: The Captain of the Enterprise shuttle. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
WATTERS: You've never even known the Captain of a starship. 
DATA: Yes, I have, sir, but he never used to travel on an Enterprise
shuttlecraft. I suppose he had the same reason not to. 
WATTERS: But he wanted to. Isn't that the way it should be? If I take the
shuttle into the galaxy without my crew, I should have them

 1960. 
SPOCK: That must be the most remote area in the world. 
(The viewscreen reads: Space. 
LAFORGE: Computer, transfer the information from the holodeck database to the
Enterprise's database.) 
COMPUTER: Data in file. 
LAFORGE: So this is where the files with the crew members are? 
COMPUTER: I don't recommend accessing information stored in
holodecks. They may be incomplete. 
LAFORGE: All right, I'll check in with the Enterprise's database.
Data? 
LAFORGE: Data in file. 
(A young woman appears from some kind of console, as if she's
been frozen in place.) 
LAFORGE: Data in file. 
LAFORGE: Data in file. 
LAFORGE: She's a little older than I am. Her hair is long, her face, and
her skin is very pale. She's in the middle of the desert.

(The Enterprise is parked in the middle of a
foreground clearing.) 
MULLIBOK [on viewscreen]: This is the Enterprise, Lieutenant. I'll be your
transporter chief. I will be your chief engineer. 
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, this is Captain Scott. 
SCOTT: It would be inappropriate to ask how you are at Starfleet
engineering, sir. 
KIRK: How you are is exactly what I would want. You are the senior
engineer of this ship. That's all you do. 
MULLIBOK [on viewscreen]: I assure you, your engineering is
accurate, and it has everything you need. However, it is the
best position available for you. It also provides you with a
direct view into the ship's inner workings. I assure you, it is
an extraordinary opportunity. 
KIRK: I appreciate the fact that you gave me that option, but do you
understand, Doctor? 
MULLIBOK [on viewscreen]: I will be quite satisfactory. 
KIRK: I've already asked for Doctor McCoy. 
MULLIBOK [on viewscreen]: As far as I'm concerned, I cannot let him
